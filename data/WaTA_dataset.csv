As a basic principle ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax,Irrelevant
These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee,Relevant
In ACME Financial Accounting a software specially developed for the ACME AG she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance invoice ,Relevant
She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form docket ,Relevant
The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list,Relevant
He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice,Relevant
Should everything be in order he notes his code one on the docket accurate position AP and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail,Relevant
From it the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager based on the docket or if all items are marked correct sent back to accounting,Relevant
Therefore the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate,Relevant
However if inconsistencies exist e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly,Relevant
Based on the statements of the cost center managers she will proceed with the clarification with the vendor but if necessary she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e mail again,Relevant
When all inconsistencies are resolved the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again and the process continues,Relevant
After all invoice items are AP the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager,Relevant
He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment,Relevant
If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20 000 the Board wants to check it again 4 eyes principle ,Relevant
The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file,Relevant
Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier,Relevant

If the request is rejected the application is returned to the applicant employee who can review the rejection reasons,Relevant
If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative who must complete the respective management procedures,Relevant
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,Relevant
Once the requirement is registered the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,Relevant
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,Relevant
If the request is rejected the process will end,Relevant
If the request is asked to make a change then it is returned to the petitioner employee who can review the comments for the change request,Relevant
If the request is approved it will go to the purchase department that will be in charge of making quotations using a subprocess and select a vendor,Relevant
If the vendor is not valid in the system the purchase department will have to choose a different vendor,Relevant
After a vendor is selected and confirmed the system will generate and send a purchase order and wait for the product to be delivered and the invoice received,Relevant
In any case the system will send a notification to let the user know what the result was,Relevant
In any of the cases approval rejection or change required the system will send the user a notification,Relevant

An employee purchases a product or service he requires,Relevant
For instance a sales person on a trip rents a car,Irrelevant
The employee submits an expense report with a list of items along with the receipts for each item,Relevant
A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report,Relevant
Since the company has expense rules there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection,Irrelevant
These rules could be automated to reduce the workload on the supervisor,Irrelevant
If the supervisor rejects the report the employee who submitted it is given a chance to edit it ,Relevant
for example to correct errors or better describe an expense,Irrelevant
If the supervisor approves the report it goes to the treasurer,Relevant
The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list,Relevant
If all is in order the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing,Relevant
including e.g. payment or refund and accounting ,Irrelevant
If receipts are missing or do not match the report he sends it back to the employee,Relevant
If a report returns to the employee for corrections it must again go to a supervisor even if the supervisor previously approved the report,Relevant
If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system,Relevant
The process waits for the payment confirmation,Relevant
After the payment is confirmed the process ends,Relevant
Every time we get a new order from the sales department first one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date,Relevant
Once that information is present it has to be entered into our production planning system PPS ,Relevant
It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized,Relevant
Besides it creates a list of parts to be procured,Relevant
Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system ERP so the data must be transferred manually,Irrelevant
By the way that is the second step,Irrelevant
Once all the data is present we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary,Relevant
Once production is scheduled to start we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation,Relevant
Finally the order will be checked again for its quality,Relevant
The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute,Relevant
This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment,Irrelevant
The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient,Relevant
On the basis of this information the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in,Relevant
The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental health and social state of the patient in question,Relevant
This information is recorded on a registration form,Relevant
At the end of the conversation this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute,Relevant
Here the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed,Relevant
For new patients a patient file is created,Relevant
The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file,Irrelevant
At the secretarial office two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient,Relevant
The new patient is added on the list of new notices,Relevant
Halfway the week at Wednesday a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place,Relevant
At this meeting the team leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team,Relevant
Each patient will be assigned to a social medical worker who will act as the first intaker of the patient,Irrelevant
One of the physicians will act as the second intaker,Irrelevant
The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office,Relevant
For each new assignment it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required,Relevant
This information is added to the assignment list,Relevant
The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system,Relevant
It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient,Relevant
For each patient for which the medical file is required the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient requesting for a copy of the medical file,Relevant
As soon as this copy is received the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file,Relevant
The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible,Relevant
During the first meeting the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out,Relevant
Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook,Relevant
After a visit the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient,Relevant
The standard checklist is also added to the patients file,Relevant
The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received,Relevant
Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients,Relevant
The secretarial office types out these tapes after which the information is added to the patient file,Relevant
As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status,Relevant
For the staff meeting on Wednesday they provide the team leader with a list of these patients,Relevant
For each of these patients the first and second intaker together with the team leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan,Relevant
This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure,Relevant
At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded,Relevant
A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO,Relevant
At the customer service an employee enters,Relevant
based on the received data ,Irrelevant
a problem report into system T,Relevant
Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are,Relevant
Based on this the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities,Relevant
An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship,Relevant
In case the customer is premium the process will link to an extra problem fix process,Relevant
this process will not be detailed here ,Irrelevant
In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon the process goes back to re prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues,Relevant
Taking together the information,Relevant
i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions ,Irrelevant
a detailed problem report is created,Relevant
The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management,Relevant
Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers,Relevant
After receiving the detailed problem report Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning,Relevant
In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning,Relevant
If Service Management is sure they can analyze it they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem,Relevant
After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report it is checked whether there are any possible problems,Relevant
If no problems are detected a notification about the normal service execution is created,Relevant
If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created,Relevant
Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management,Relevant
Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information,Relevant
Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report,Relevant
Three alternative process paths may be taken,Irrelevant
For the case that no problem was detected at all the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service,Relevant
For the case that minor corrective actions are required Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves,Relevant
Subsequently the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service,Relevant
After sending this process path of Service Management ends,Relevant
For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration,Relevant
This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning,Relevant
Resource Provisioning has been on hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process,Relevant
After the restoration request is received all possible errors are tracked,Relevant
Based on the tracked errors all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning,Relevant
Then a trouble shooting report is created,Relevant
This report is sent out to Service Management then the process ends,Relevant
The trouble shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ,Relevant
Customer Service either receives the actual service performance if there was no problem or the problem resolution report,Relevant
Then two concurrent activities are triggered i.e.,Relevant
i a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem ,Relevant
and ii an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing   Collections who will adjust the billing,Relevant
The report for the customer is sent out to her,Relevant
After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service,Relevant
After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service the process flow at the customer also ends,Relevant
The process is initiated by a switch over request,Relevant
In doing so the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company,Relevant
Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution,Irrelevant
The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system,Relevant
After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility,Relevant
In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list,Relevant
The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times,Irrelevant
In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow,Relevant
This object consists of data elements such as the customer s name and address and the assigned power gauge including data such as bank connection information on the selected rate requested date of switch over ,Irrelevant
The generated customer object is then used in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch,Relevant
including data such as bank connection information on the selected rate requested date of switch over ,Irrelevant
In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS customer information system in order to confirm their successful generation,Relevant
In case of a negative response ,Relevant
i.e. the contract documents are not or incorrectly generated,Irrelevant
the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved,Relevant
Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again,Relevant
In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch over to the new supplier can be executed,Relevant
A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS,Relevant
It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future,Relevant
The switch over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence and the grid operator transmits a response comment,Relevant
In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict,Relevant
The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier,Relevant
i.e. the customer service of the new supplier does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ,Irrelevant
If there are not any objections by the grid operator,Relevant
i.e. no supplier concurrence ,Irrelevant
customer service creates a CIS contract,Relevant
The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it,Relevant
Depending on the customer s acceptance rejection the process flow at customer service either ends in case of withdrawal or continues in case of a confirmation ,Relevant
An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues,Relevant
The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way but it can speed up the switch process,Irrelevant
On the switch date but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report,Relevant
At the same time the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier,Relevant
Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer,Relevant
For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then,Relevant
After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information,Relevant
The process of winning a new customer ends here,Relevant
The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers,Relevant
This can be achieved in several ways,Irrelevant
Sometimes we buy details for cold calls sometimes our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes you just happen to know somebody who is interested in the product,Relevant
Then we start calling the customer,Relevant
That is done by the call center staff,Relevant
They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project,Relevant
Of course asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important,Relevant
If this is not the case we leave him alone except if the potential project budget is huge,Relevant
Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer,Relevant
If the customer is interested in the end the next step is a detailed online presentation,Relevant
It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre sales employee in case of a more technical presentation,Irrelevant
Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us,Relevant
If we are not contacted within 2 weeks a sales representative is calling the customer,Relevant
The last phase is the creation of a quotation,Relevant
The credit company receives the credit information from the customer If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,Relevant
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
After the assessment if the risk is high an approval must be requested but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant
After the approval request the credit could be accepted or rejected in both cases an email is sent to the customer,Relevant
The credit company collects the credit information from the customer If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,Relevant
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
After the assessment if the risk is high an approval must be requested but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant
After the approval request the credit could be accepted or rejected in both cases an email is sent to the customer,Relevant
The credit company collects the credit information from the customer If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
After the assessment if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant
If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ or the risk of the credit is high an approval must be requested,Relevant
After the approval request the credit could be accepted or rejected in both cases an email is sent to the customer,Relevant
If a not collected bag is identified CVS must check the number of resolution retries conducted,Relevant
If the number of retries is greater than an specified number the bag must be returned to the production area for disassemble in all other cases CVS must try to contact the customer by phone and remind to pick up the bag,Relevant
If the contact is successful and the customer withdrawn the order the bag must be returned to the production area for disassemble but if it is successful and the customer promises to pick up the bag CVS must increase the retry count on the bag label,Relevant
Also this number must be increased if the contact is unsuccessful,Relevant
As soon as an employee files an expense report the process is started,Relevant
The process starts by reviewing the order,Relevant
The staff should check if all the requested items are available,Relevant
If something is missing the staff has to inform customer about a potential delay and order the missing products,Relevant
In the exceptional case of a discontinued item the customer should be informed about the not longer available items,Relevant
After waiting an average of x days for the delivery the staff should check again if all products are on store,Relevant
If everything is OK then the staff recollects all products and prepare a package,Relevant
The courier is then informed about the pre processed package,Relevant
The courier company informs the client about a potential delay until there are enough human resources to process the delivery,Relevant
Then the package is picked up by the designed driver,Relevant
A centralized service decides the best route to deliver all drivers packages,Relevant
Once the driver delivers the package she should update the system so all stakeholders are notified,Relevant
The process starts with an informational meeting among the web design team,Relevant
If this meeting is not successful the process ends here,Relevant
Otherwise the team starts by creating a storyboard,Relevant
After an agreement on the storyboard part of the team starts working on the design and development of the website,Relevant
Simultaneously the team will start to prepare an initial draft of the content,Relevant
In case a review of the draft is needed the marketing team will conduct this before the web design team creates the final version of the content,Relevant
When the development and content have been completed the website will be built and reviewed,Relevant
If the site is approved the process is completed otherwise the team goes back to the building step,Relevant
After management indicates that new clients are needed the marketing team will perform a market analysis and prepare a portfolio presentation,Relevant
When they have sent out offers to potential clients the marketing team informs management about the responses,Relevant
Management then starts negotiations by sending out a detailed offer to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer management will prepare a contract that will be signed,Relevant
Otherwise management analyzes the reason why their offer failed in order to improve in the future,Relevant
An order to cash process starts when a customer order is received,Relevant
After the order has been processed it is send to the warehouse,Relevant
The warehouse employees determine the parts required to produce the requested items,Relevant
If any parts are not available in the warehouse these are ordered,Relevant
Once all necessary parts are available production will start,Relevant
After production quality checks will be performed,Relevant
If the production process has finished products will be packaged and labeled before returning to the warehouse,Relevant
Finally sales will be informed about the completed production and the product can be sold to the customer,Relevant
A client who wants to create a Paypal account first needs to determine the desired account type,Relevant
He should either select a personal account or a premium account,Relevant
Afterwards the client should enter login details,Relevant
such as e mail address and desired password personal details such as name and date of birth as well as his telephone number and address,Irrelevant
Finally the client needs to declare if he has been affiliated with any politically exposed person,Relevant
When the client clicks the create account button the details will be sent to the Paypal system,Relevant
When a request is received the system will validate the input fields,Relevant
If there are any invalid fields the client will be notified and needs to correct them,Relevant
Otherwise a welcome email will be generated and sent to indicate that an account has been created,Relevant
The process starts when the IS is notified about a data validation error,Relevant
The drop off tech checks for typos,Relevant
If this is not the case the technician checks if the customer can correct the mistake,Relevant
Otherwise public sources are scoured for solutions,Relevant
As soon as any check was passed the issue is considered resolved,Relevant
Once the Mail Centre office of SSP receives an invoice from the client it categorizes the invoice by staff member,Relevant
Then the invoice is forwarded to the Administration Department this Department processes the Invoice a complex process and then puts all the invoices into a collection box,Relevant
At 10 am every workday the Data Entry office takes the invoices and enters all data in the SAP system another complex process,Relevant
Every hour the Mail Centre office reviews the system and forwards all new invoices for validation the Validation office executes the big process of validating invoices,Relevant
At the beginning of every week the Payment office executes the payment of every validate invoice this is another big process,Relevant
After the payment all invoices are archived by the Registry office,Relevant
The process starts when the SO: Angebot Auftrag receives a subsidiary order,Relevant
The SO: Angebot Auftrag prepares goods for shipment and then ships the goods concurrently with preparing the goods and shipping them the SO: Angebot Auftrag prepares invoicing,Relevant
In case the customer is subsidiary and the subsidiary relationship is not yet modeled SO: Address management adds parent company as invoicing address then the SO: Angebot Auftrag create the invoice,Relevant
Otherwise if the customer is independent or the subsidiary relationship is already modeled in ERP the SO: Angebot Auftrag directly creates the invoice,Relevant
Finally the SO: Angebot Auftrag sends the invoice,Relevant
In a certain company an Invoice process is started,Irrelevant
First the Vendor is tried to be located into the SAP system of the company,Relevant
If it is not possible to find it a sub process to record this new Vendor is started,Relevant
The request for this new Vendor Record starts with the filling of the new Vendor Master Record form,Relevant
After this the request is attached to the invoice and then putted in an internal outbox for new vendors,Relevant
Before the request is finished it is classified in urgent and non urgent invoices,Relevant
Whenever the Invoice is urgent this Request has a maximum 24 hr window to be finished while if it is non urgent it has a 1 5 working days time to be done,Relevant
If the Vendor is already in the system or the request for new Vendor Record has finished its SAP number is then added to the invoice and the process continues,Relevant
The invoices can be sorted in two ways: by amount and by vendor,Irrelevant
The invoices are then entered in the SAP system and the process is finished,Relevant
The process starts when the admin office in SSP receives the invoice the admin office then sorts the invoice per client sorts the invoice per vendor attaches invoice entry form to invoice enters required info on the invoice entry form and checks the completeness of the invoice after the client has completed the invoice,Relevant
If the invoice is not completed a message is sent and the process finishes,Relevant
Otherwise if the invoice is complete the admin office enters the info for the SLA and checks the priority,Relevant
If the invoice has high priority the admin office applies the red stamp on entry invoice,Relevant
Afterwards the admin office checks the invoice compliance,Relevant
If the invoice is complete the admin office allocates invoice to DEO,Relevant
Otherwise if the invoice is not complete the admin office can either send it to experience staff who should process the non compliance invoice call the client and request for information or send a postal mail requesting the information complete in this case a reminder is sent to the client after 10 hours,Relevant
Finally when the missing information are obtained the admin office can allocate invoice to DEO,Relevant
The process starts with the business analyst collecting data and conducting business analysis regarding customer feedback then the web designer integrates the design and decides where the customer feedback module should be placed,Relevant
The business analyst waits until the design is complete then she checks the design and provides feedback,Relevant
If the design needs adjustment the web designer has to change the design and integrates the design and decides where the customer feedback module should be placed again,Relevant
If the design is OK,Relevant
The PHP HTML CSS specialist integrates with the overall implementation and then the tester tests the final website to make sure everything is going well,Relevant
If the test is OK the process ends otherwise if the test is not ok the tester provides test results to the PHP HTML CSS specialist who adjusts according to the test results and integrates the overall implementation again,Relevant
In the process of adding a credit card for an internet purchase after choosing to pay with credit card the user has to put his credit card details after that the billing address is checked,Relevant
If it is incorrect the process goes back to the user so that it can be modified if it is correct the process continues,Relevant
Afterwards the user needs to click in the continue button to move forward,Relevant
The Credit Card is then verified by the Credit Card Authority,Relevant
The result is then checked and if it is validated the credit card is added if not the addition is cancelled,Relevant
The process starts with a visitor filling out a registration form,Relevant
The availability of products and the credit rating is checked first,Relevant
If the credit rating is higher than 9000 according to Schufa the registration is called unsuccessful,Relevant
If not the interim customer dataset record is created,Relevant
After this two sub processes starts in parallel: Device provision and Register customer account at ISP nodes,Relevant
Once these sub processes are finished a welcome package is created and sent to the customer to alert them that the registration process was completed successfully,Relevant
A PayPal client wants to pay with bank account and has selected this as payment option,Relevant
For bank account addition first the PayPal client needs to enter all relevant bank details ,Relevant
i.e. first name bank name account type BSB and account number ,Irrelevant
and click continue,Relevant
This submits the bank details to the PayPal system,Relevant
After the bank details are submitted to the PayPal system it makes two random deposits in the bank account,Relevant
The PayPal system sends a message with this information to the client bank account,Relevant
By this the two deposits to the bank account are made,Relevant
Then after 3 5 working days it notifies the PayPal client to check his bank account for received deposits,Relevant
The client may now log into his PayPal account enter the amounts from the two deposits and click verify,Relevant
The PayPal system then checks its values against the values entered by the client,Relevant
If the values match the bank account is linked to the clients PayPal account and is considered as confirmed,Relevant
If the values do not match the bank account is removed from the PayPal system i.e. it could not be confirmed,Relevant
In the process of reward and training first the management checks the employee performance,Relevant
If the performance is less than 20 the management suggests the employee s dismissal to the human resources department HR ,Relevant
Then the HR dismisses the employee,Relevant
If the employee performance is greater than 20 but less than 50 the management will suggest training which in turn is provided by HR,Relevant
If the performance exceeds 75 the management suggests the employee for reward,Relevant
There may be either a financial reward or an other benefit,Relevant
Regarding the latter the management chooses an appropriate benefit,Relevant
The financial reward is calculated and payed by the finance departement,Relevant
Finally the management announces the rewarded employee as employee of the month,Relevant
This process describes how purchases work at the ACME Inc company,Irrelevant
A purchase is initiated by a demand identified within a department,Relevant
If there are enough goods in stock to satisfy this demand then they are consumed locally and no further action is required,Relevant
Otherwise the department defines which type of goods are needed and the necessary amounts and a purchase requisition is created in the ERP system,Relevant
This purchase requisition is processed by the Central procurement department,Relevant
First the purchase requisition is checked on the ERP system to see whether the supplier information is available,Relevant
If this is a new supplier first it has to be created within the ERP system,Relevant
Once it is created or it if was already a known supplier the purchase requisition is used to create an order template in the ERP system,Relevant
The final step in the process is the approval of this order which is granted by another role called approver,Irrelevant
After receiving the new order template from the ERP system he approves and triggers the purchase order,Relevant
In ACME Inc the process of purchase order to delivery is started by the financial department,Relevant
They check the purchase invoice and then sends it to the department,Relevant
The department checks the invoice for factual correctness and registers this in the SAPERION workflow system,Relevant
After this a check is performed to see if the amount purchased is over $500 or under $500,Relevant
If it is over $500 the invoice is sent to the department head who then uses the SAPERION workflow to approve the invoice,Relevant
Once this has been done or if the amount of the order is under $500 the ERP system is triggered for payment and the process ends,Relevant
The account creation process at this bank proceeds as follows,Irrelevant
The first steps in the process are performed by the bank customer,Irrelevant
After visiting the bank website she fills in her personal data and generates a PDF document with all the information relevant to this account request,Relevant
After printing this PDF the customer needs to visit a post office to send these documents,Relevant
The post officer will check the identity of the customer and mail the account to the bank,Relevant
At the bank the person in charge of making a decision on account requests is the bank officer,Relevant
Once he receives a new request hell check the customer data,Relevant
Depending on the available information and his own criteria he may either accept or reject the request,Relevant
In the former case he will mail the account documents to the customer,Relevant
In the latter he will mail a letter of refusal,Relevant
A small company manufactures customized bicycles,Irrelevant
Whenever the sales department receives an order a new process instance is created,Relevant
A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike,Relevant
In the former case the process instance is finished,Relevant
In the latter case the storehouse and the engineering department are informed,Relevant
The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part,Relevant

h If the student logs out from LPIS the process is over ,Relevant
a A customer wants to rent a car ,Relevant
The customer service agent looks into the customer system to verify if the customer is an existing one or if he is new ,Relevant
b If the customer is new the customer service agent inserts personal data and driver`s license information into the system ,Relevant
If the customer is a business client the service agent also has to enter a corporate bonus program ,Relevant
c Whether it is a new or an existing customer the process continues with verifying a possible corporate bonus program ,Relevant
Then he has to allocate possible additional services for this program ,Relevant
d Afterwards the customer has to specify the rental period requested by the service agent ,Relevant
e The customer chooses a vehicle class and additional features ,Relevant
The customer service agent looks into the system to see if a suitable car is available or not ,Relevant
f If no suitable car is available the customer service agent will look for an alternative for the customer until a car is found ,Relevant
Therefore the service agent asks the customer for different features ,Relevant
g If the car rental couldn`t offer a suitable car the customer leaves the shop and the process ends ,Relevant
h If a suitable car is found the customer has to choose the type of insurance he wants and has to decide if he wants a chauffeur ,Relevant
i If the customer wants a chauffeur the customer service agent chooses an available one for the period requested ,Relevant
j Then the customer service agent prints the invoice which the customer has to sign ,Relevant
At the same time the customer has to pay a deposit which can be in cash or by credit card ,Relevant
k If both the invoice is signed and the deposit paid the customer service agent gives the customer the keys documents and necessary information about the car e g fuel emergency number where he can pick up the car etc ,Relevant
l Afterwards the customer goes to the car park ,Relevant
There he shows the invoice to the dispatcher ,Relevant
m The dispatcher brings the customer to the rented car ,Relevant
n The transaction is completed the process ends ,Relevant
a A customer wants to start an auction ,Relevant
Therefore he must login in the auction system with his username and his password ,Relevant
If he enters this combination wrong three times the system blocks the login for half an hour ,Relevant
b If the login is correct the system verifies whether the account is activated or not using the account information ,Relevant
If the account has not yet been activated the system forwards the user to the activating window and ends the start process ,Relevant
c If the account has been activated the system verifies if the account is blocked ,Relevant
If a block exists the customer will be informed and the system ends the start process ,Relevant
d If the customer is not blocked the system forwards him in his account ,Relevant
There he can create an auction with the management software MS ,Relevant
At the beginning the customer has to choose one category ,Relevant
e After that he has to enter the title of the auction and he can upload one or more images ,Relevant
There is a maximum size for the images so the system will verify this automatically ,Relevant
If the picture is too big the customer has to choose another one ,Relevant
f Following this the seller has to enter some product specific information and an individual description ,Relevant
g After entering both the customer has to input end time payment details and transport information ,Relevant
h When the seller has entered all these information he can see a preview ,Relevant
The seller can decide if he is satisfied or if he wants to change some entries ,Relevant
Therefore the system goes back to the first step where the customer has to choose a category ,Relevant
i When the customer is satisfied he posts the auction on the website the process is over ,Relevant
a There are two ways the process may be started ,Relevant
On the one hand a customer is interested in a specific product or group of products and approaches the customer consultant to speak to him ,Relevant
On the other hand when the customer consultant approaches the customer ,Relevant
b Following successful first contact the potential customers says what he would like or what he is interested in ,Relevant
c The customer consultant looks for a suitable product ,Relevant
If he doesn t find a suitable product he speaks with the customer about alternatives ,Relevant
d Is the customer interested in alternative products the consultant looks again if he can find a suitable one ,Relevant
If the customer is not interested in alternative products the process is over ,Relevant
e If the customer likes the product the customer consultant checks if the product is currently in stock ,Relevant
If it is in stock the customer gets an invoice ,Relevant
f The size must be verified is it a small product the customer can collect it and take it with him ,Relevant
g On the other hand if it is a bully product the customer is given an order confirmation and with this he can pick up the product from the warehouse ,Relevant
h The invoice must be paid at the cash desk The customer then gets a receipt ,Relevant
If the customer has the product in his possession the buying process is over ,Relevant
i When it is not in his possession he has to go to the warehouse with the receipt and the order confirmation where he receives the product ,Relevant
The buying process is over ,Relevant
j If the product is not in stock the customer consultant will order it ,Relevant
The customer receives an order confirmation and an invoice ,Relevant
k The customer consultant makes a note of the customer`s phone number in order to contact him when the product has been delivered ,Relevant
l The customer leaves the shop and has to wait for the product ,Relevant
a The customer takes the item to the delivery store in order to send it ,Relevant
The cashier verifies on the customer system whether the customer is a new or an existing one ,Relevant
b If they are new customers the cashier asks if they want to be repeat customers or simply casual customers ,Relevant
If they are repeat customers their details are entered into the system ,Relevant
c All customers need a form to send the item ,Relevant
The customer can either print it out at home and bring it already filled out or the cashier can give him the form to fill out in store ,Relevant
d The cashier has to check if all necessary information has been completed ,Relevant
If not the cashier and the customer fill in the missing sections ,Relevant
e After the form has been filled out the cashier has to wrap the package for delivery ,Relevant
f The weight of the package must be determined to find out the base price weight categories ,Relevant
Then the cashier has to enter into the system if the package is fragile or dangerous ,Relevant
g Next the cashier has to verify if the customer wants additional criteria e g quick delivery insurance and enter this information into the system ,Relevant
h In the next step the cashier tells the customer the price ,Relevant
i The customer pays the price ,Relevant
At the same time the cashier prepares and prints the receipt and gives it to the customer ,Relevant
j The item is placed into the correct box the sending process is completed ,Relevant
a The process starts with the arrival of a client with a car ,Relevant
Once the client is already in the office the front office clerk checks the existing appointments ,Relevant
b If no appointment exists the front office clerk tries to determine what sort of problem the customer has with his vehicle and once the possible problem has been determined and records about it have been made the front office clerk checks the local IT system using the created records to determine which division s is are responsible for this kind of problem ,Relevant
After one or several divisions has have been found in the system the front office clerk checks for free capacities ,Relevant
On the other hand if the customer already has an appointment the the following process is described in d ,Relevant
c For the case that free capacities are available please follow d too ,Relevant
If no free capacities are available the front office clerk checks the schedule for free dates ,Relevant
Once the calendar with appointments has been checked the front office clerk suggests an appointment ,Relevant
If the customer agrees the process continues with the storage of the damaged car described in d ,Relevant
Customers who decline the offer leave the service station and the process is over ,Relevant
There is also a possible case when a customer agrees to make an appointment but doesn t come back ,Relevant
d The office clerk stores the car ,Relevant
To perform this task he needs a car number and customer data to enter them in the local IT system ,Relevant
After the car has been stored the process continues with the actual repair process navigation Repairs described in e ,Relevant
Once the repair s has have been done the front office clerk gives the car to the customer the local IT system is used ,Relevant
At the same time the accounting department issues a bill using customer and car data as well as information about the repair work provided the system is Accounting   Management ,Relevant
Finally when the both processes are completed the customer leaves the service station ,Relevant
e Once the car has been stored the front office clerk uses the IT system to determine the next car to be sent for repair schedule records car number and division data are entered Thereafter he has to check if the car is clean ,Relevant
For cars that need cleansing the front office dispatches them to an in house car wash ,Relevant
Then the front office determines the division responsible for the car ,Relevant
The three possible problems may refer to painting   exterior problems engine problems or electrical problems ,Relevant
A single car can visit one or multiple divisions that responsible for different kind of problems ,Irrelevant
f For cars with painting exterior problems the automotive paints division at first determines the work scope ,Relevant
The vehicle either needs whole new body paint or only particular parts need to be painted ,Relevant
When the second case applies the automotive paints division dismounts the chosen parts and at the same time makes records about them in the IT system ,Relevant
Once the car is prepared by the division for this process they need car parts and automotive paints as inputs they can conduct the paint job ,Relevant
g For cars with engine problems the mechanical repairs division firstly examines the car engine ,Relevant
Depending on the damage and the number of damaged parts the parts are either repaired or new parts are needed or both cases apply for different damaged parts ,Relevant
For repairable parts the mechanical repairs division uses specialized manufacturer s software and repairs the single parts In the second case the division purchases new parts directly from supplier specialized software used ,Relevant
Once the parts have been repaired or the new parts have been delivered they have to be installed ,Relevant
When the engine is ready the mechanics start it up ,Relevant
If the engine works properly the problem is solved ,Relevant
In any other case a problem still exists and the mechanical repairs division has to examine the engine once more performing all steps again ,Relevant
h For cars with electrical problems the electrical repairs division finds the problem using specialized manufacturer s software that is needed at every step for the particular car brand ,Relevant
When the problem is found the electrical repairs division performs the repair ,Relevant
Afterwards they inspect if everything works properly ,Relevant
A successful repair means that the work in this division is done ,Relevant
In any other case the repair has been unsuccessful and has to be performed again ,Relevant
i After completion of the work in any of the three divisions the quality control division performs a quality check ,Relevant
If problems still exist or another repair has to be done the car is sent back to the front office to determine the division that will proceed with it ,Relevant
Alternatively if the car is ready the front office clerk stores the car ,Relevant
a The book production process starts when the acquiring editor submits a final book manuscript to the copy editor ,Relevant
The copy editor then reviews the final manuscript using his Book Editing Software ,Relevant
As a result all grammar errors spelling errors or consistency errors are found ,Relevant
Afterwards the copy editor corrects them and at the same time questions everything that is not clear in the text ,Relevant
b Once the manuscript has been copyedited an overall design direction is determined for the book by the creative team and the editor book design software ,Relevant
Then the creative team sends sample pages to the author ,Relevant
After receipt of the sample pages the creative team finalizes the design of the manuscript ,Relevant
c At the same time the copy editor submits the manuscript with queries to the editor and the author ,Relevant
The author and the editor answer the queries and after that consult to finalize the text ,Relevant
d When the former processes are both finished b and c the creative team creates a dummy book from the manuscript and the prepared design ,Relevant
Thereafter all parties that participated in the process so far review the page layout fit the copy gauge the appropriateness of art to text and if necessary make other changes the system used are design software and editing software ,Relevant
After completion of these tasks the editor and the creative team check if the reviews made are sufficient ,Relevant
If not the dummy book has to be reviewed once again by all parties ,Relevant
e After a positive check the text is sent back to the author ,Relevant
He either receives the text and art in a dummy book or in page proofs and the process continues with f ,Relevant
In a parallel timeframe the page proofs are reviewed by the editor a proofreader and members of the production staff ,Relevant
If they find typos in the text the typos are corrected by the editor ,Relevant
After all typos have been corrected and minor changes have been made the editor checks if a fine tuning is needed ,Relevant
If the need exists the review of the page proofs starts again if not the process continues as described in f ,Relevant
f For the files sent for printing and binding the printing and binding process has to be executed ,Relevant
g For the files sent for printing and binding the printing and binding process has to be executed ,Relevant
Thereafter the printing services synchronously send samples of the printed book to the sales department send publicity mailings to media partners distribute samples and rush advanced samples to the publisher ,Relevant
Once all these tasks are done the printing services ship the books to the publisher s warehouse ,Relevant
The publisher chooses to ship the books to individual bookstores or to distribution centers ,Relevant
h For the files sent to the file converter the e book could be either prepared in house or alternatively from a freelancer ,Relevant
When the preparation of the e book is done the online retailers make the books available online using data feeds systems ,Relevant
As of now when books are already at the online retailers they offer them to purchase and download on their websites online bookstore system ,Relevant
i The manufacturing process ends after the last shipment of books from the publisher is ready and the books are available in the online stores ,Relevant
The books are now in the hands of booksellers and consumers ,Irrelevant
The apex locator is an electronic device used in endodontics a dental specialty to determine the opening at the apex of the root of a tooth through which the nerve and blood vessels pass ,Irrelevant
The device presented has a multimedia display and operates with two buttons a power button ON OFF and VOLUME button to control the volume of the voice messages that guide the dentist during the measurement process ,Irrelevant
In addition a demo mode presentation can be started by holding the power button for a few seconds ,Irrelevant
The device uses a Li ion battery and the charging method is similar with this of a cell phone ,Irrelevant
a Upon pushing the ON OFF button or plugging in the AC adapter the software program starts the central processing unit and at the same time initializes the display driver ,Relevant
Once the display is active the software program performs a check to find out if the AC adapter is plugged in ,Relevant
If this is the case please follow e if not follow b ,Relevant
b If no adapter is plugged in the system checks if the ON OFF button is still pushed ,Relevant
If the check is negative please follow c For a positive check follow d ,Relevant
c If the ON OFF button is not pushed the system loads an initial display ,Relevant
Once the initial display is started and the device is ready to measure the software program checks if the VOLUME button has been pushed ,Relevant
If the check is negative the following process is described in f if the check is positive follow g ,Relevant
d A positive check leads to the activation of the demo mode ,Relevant
Then the system displays a demo part ,Relevant
Once it has been displayed the system checks if this has been the last part ,Relevant
If it is not the last one the process starts over and the system displays the next demo part ,Relevant
A positive check means that all parts have been presented and leads to the new waiting activity described in k ,Relevant
e If the adapter is plugged in the charging program is activated ,Relevant
Once the charging program is running the system shows a Charging message on the display ,Relevant
After that the software measures the elapsed time before continuing with further actions time data is used ,Relevant
If the waiting time is less than 60 seconds the system continues to wait ,Relevant
Alternative if the waiting time exceeds 60 seconds the system automatically switches the display off ,Relevant
Then it regularly checks if any button has been pushed ,Relevant
When this is the case the Charging message has to be shown again ,Relevant
If no buttons have been pushed the system proceeds with the waiting activity described in k ,Relevant
f For the case that the VOLUME button has not been pushed the device starts with the measurement process deciding which measurement method is most appropriate ,Relevant
The choice is between method #1 method #2 or none of both ,Relevant
g For the case that it has been pushed the volume is increased by one level ,Relevant
Then either the volume already equals the maximum level which demands the system to mute the device or it is less than the maximum ,Relevant
Regardless of which case applies the system always performs the VOLUME button check again ,Relevant
h If method #1 has been chosen the software program performs it ,Relevant
Once the method is performed and results are displayed the system makes again the initial decision about which method is most suitable ,Relevant
i If method #2 is suitable the system determines whether subprogram #2 1 or #2 2 is appropriate and after that performs the chosen one ,Relevant
After a subprogram has been performed and results are displayed additionally for #2 2 as a result log files are saved the software can choose again an appropriate method ,Relevant
j The third option when no appropriate method is found leads also to the waiting activity described in k ,Relevant
k The system now waits again and if 30 seconds have not been exceeded the process starts all over again and the system checks again for an AC adapter ,Relevant
Finally in the case that 30 or more seconds have already passed the device automatically turns off ,Relevant
a When developing a motherboard the hardware design department selects a chipset that meets the requirements ,Relevant
The module used by this department is called design software Design SW is used at every step in this part ,Irrelevant
After the chipset reference schematics and the chipset documents have been downloaded the same department proceeds with searching for an appropriate motherboard ,Relevant
If the board is not close to the custom specification the search process starts again ,Relevant
Otherwise if a board closest to the custom specification has been found it is then used as a starting schematic ,Relevant
Then simultaneously the design department adds features from other reference boards and removes the useless features from the selected starting schematic ,Relevant
b In the next step the hardware design department adds peripherals ,Relevant
Then the same department assures if there is an existing BIOS support for the peripherals and at the same time finds all reference boards of the peripherals that are not available on the chipset ,Relevant
For the case that no BIOS support is available the process of adding of peripherals starts all over again ,Relevant
Once the reference boards are found the materials management department module MM contacts the manufacturers of the peripherals that are not from the chipset ,Relevant
As a result the manufacturer s information is provided ,Relevant
Once this is done and the BIOS support for all peripherals is available the hardware design department continues to the next step follow c ,Relevant
c The hardware design department now assures that the reference schematics for every peripheral used are available ,Relevant
If any reference schematic is missing the corresponding peripheral has to be replaced by a new one the process starts over with the activity where peripherals are added ,Relevant
If all reference schematics are available the hardware design department customizes them which triggers the creation of a schematic symbol library ,Relevant
Then the materials management department searches for components in every supplier database ,Relevant
Once all components have been found both the materials management and the hardware design department together gather all components information ,Relevant
Then in parallel the materials management department updates the description the manufacturer information the product numbers and the supplier s information ,Relevant
As a result a preliminary schematic is available ,Relevant
d Thereafter the materials management department simultaneously generates a preliminary BOM and determines the component s prices using the preliminary schematic and the component s information ,Relevant
After that the same department compares the prices ,Relevant
There are two possible scenarios ,Irrelevant
The chosen components are either offered at best prices or there are cheaper components on the market ,Relevant
If the first case applies please follow f ,Relevant
For the second case that there are cheaper components on the market the hardware design department checks the component s quality ,Relevant
If the quality of the components is worse than this of the components chosen before please follow f ,Relevant
e For the case that the quality is the same or better the materials management department contacts the new supplier and as a result conditions are negotiated ,Relevant
Alternatively components may not be available via standard supplier and the materials management contacts directly the manufacturer using the quotation data and the manufacturer s contact information ,Relevant
Consequently a quotation is made ,Relevant
Regardless of which of the both cases applies the process goes back to adding the new peripherals ,Relevant
f In the next step the sales department using the Sales information system calculates the price of the prototype and at the same time the price for board quantity of one thousand pieces ,Relevant
Thereafter the hardware design department is responsible for the following procedures components fitment checking board size checking carrying out of preliminary placement creation of 3D model of the board connector s fitment checking and components height checking some of the input data used are components chipset 3D data and connectors ,Relevant
g After finishing of all procedures two possible outcomes exist ,Relevant
In the first case problems have occurred after the previous checks ,Relevant
This forces the hardware design department to revise the problematic component s ,Relevant
If a peripheral needs to be replaced the whole process starts over from adding a new one ,Relevant
If the revision has been successful or the second case applies when the previous checks are done without any problems the hardware department finishes the checkup ,Relevant
As a result a checked schematic and a 3D model of the board are available and also the library is updated ,Relevant
The materials management department can now order the components ,Relevant
Once they are received the hardware design department does the final placement ,Relevant
As the final outcomes both the placement and the preliminary layout are done ,Relevant
a The process starts when a customer has entered the restaurant ,Relevant
The hostess then asks for an existing reservation ,Relevant
If the customer says that he has a reservation she checks the reservation entries using the reservation system ,Relevant
Then in the case that a reservation entry is found in the system the hostess guides the customer to his table ,Relevant
b In any other case if the customer says that he does not have a reservation or a reservation entry cannot be found the hostess searches for a free table ,Relevant
If a table is found she guides the customer to it ,Relevant
If not she asks him to wait ,Relevant
While he is still waiting the hostess searches again for a free table ,Relevant
In the case that the customer is unwilling to wait he leaves the restaurant and the process is over ,Relevant
c Once the customer is at the table the waitress brings the menu ,Relevant
After that she asks for orders ,Relevant
The customer either wants to order or not ,Relevant
d For a customer that wants to order the waitress takes the order using the ordering system ,Relevant
The customer may want something to drink something to eat or both *,Relevant
In the first case the waitress passes the order to the bartender and once the drinks are ready she serves them ,Relevant
In the second case the same process applies to the meals here the order is passed to the kitchen ,Relevant
After the order is served the waitress waits until the customer finishes his meal ,Relevant
Once this he has finished she asks again for orders ,Relevant
*The case when a customer orders several meals in one go is ignored ,Irrelevant
e For a customer that does not want to order the waitress has to determine the reason ,Relevant
The customer either does not have more orders or alternative he is still not ready with his order ,Relevant
f If the customer is still not ready the waitress waits ,Relevant
Then after the customer has called the waitress or appropriate time is left the waitress asks again for orders ,Relevant
g If the customer does not want to order more the waitress brings the bill ,Relevant
Here the order and billing data are needed for the billing system ,Relevant
Once the bill is at the table the waitress determines the payment method ,Relevant
Customers normally either want to pay cash in which case the waitress settles the bill immediately or want to pay with credit card ,Relevant
In the second case she brings the mobile POS mobile POS system ,Relevant
In the next step the customer pays with his credit card and as a result the bill is settled ,Relevant
Finally the customer leaves the restaurant and the process is over ,Relevant
The Customer Service Representative sends a Mortgage offer to the customer and waits for a reply ,Relevant
If the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage the case details are updated and the work is then archived prior to cancellation ,Relevant

A travel agency wants to establish a booking service ,Irrelevant
The service is triggered by an incoming request and can return two different messages either an unavailable notification or a confirmation ,Irrelevant
The business process of the service starts by first checking the request ,Relevant
If for certain reasons the request can only be handled manually by an employee e g group travels a sub process for manual handling is activated ,Relevant
Otherwise the process enters a transactional sub process where a bus and hotel booking occur in parallel ,Relevant
However if one of these fails the transaction is canceled a log message is written and the unavailability message is sent ,Relevant
If both bookings succeed an attraction is booked by invoking another service ,Relevant
The only thing that could go wrong is a timeout i e the attraction booking service is not responding in time ,Irrelevant
If this happens a manual handling of the booking has to be made ,Relevant
If the attraction booking invocation succeeds a confirmation is sent ,Relevant
The manual handling always results in a successful booking in which case a confirmation message is sent ,Relevant

The hiring process begins by identifying a need within your organization ,Relevant
This need could vary from filling a vacated position better managing a team s workload or expanding the reach of organizational tasks ,Irrelevant
Positions are in other words either newly formed or recently vacated ,Irrelevant
Once an organization identifies a hiring need it should begin recruitment ,Relevant
In the case of newly formed positions organizations should clearly identify how the new role aligns with its goals and business plan ,Relevant
Organizations should also keep relevant internal teams and employees apprised of the new position at each stage of the hiring process ,Relevant
It s important that all those involved in the hiring decision agree to the hiring process steps and appropriate communication channels ,Irrelevant
Recruitment also includes strategizing how to publicize the new position both internally and externally criteria for initial candidate screening what the interview process will look like and who will conduct interviews ,Irrelevant
The hiring staff should start by generating a job description that includes a prioritized list of job requirements special qualifications desired characteristics and requisite experience ,Relevant
The job description should also include information regarding salary and benefits ,Irrelevant
Identifying highly qualified potential candidates begins internally ,Relevant
Start therefore by notifying current employees of the opening ,Relevant
Advertising the job may stop there if you are determined to fill the position internally ,Relevant
If however you are interested in external candidates you should include this information when you notify internally ,Relevant
External publicity will likely consist of utilizing a combination of the company s website and social media platforms job posting sites like LinkedIn job fairs industry publications and events local newspaper advertisements and word of mouth recruitment ,Relevant
Beyond simple job posts the hiring staff should reach out directly to desirable candidates via LinkedIn social media and job fairs ,Relevant
Active recruitment will help generate applications from potential candidates who are not actively searching for new jobs but may be perfect for the available position ,Irrelevant
Your organization likely already has a mechanism in place to receive applications via email an applicant tracking system ATS etc ,Relevant
In many cases the review process begins with Human Resource representatives who review the applications and eliminate any candidate who does not meet the minimum requirements for the position or the company more generally ,Relevant
In other instances the hiring team or hiring manager may prefer to review each application ,Relevant
Once a batch of qualified applications are assembled the hiring staff should review the remaining candidates and identify those they want to interview ,Relevant
Initial interviews typically begin with phone calls with HR representatives ,Relevant
Phone interviews determine if applicants possess the requisite qualifications to fill the position and align with an organization s culture and values ,Irrelevant
Phone interviews enable organizations to further pare down the list of candidates while expending company resources efficiently ,Irrelevant
Depending on the size of the organization and hiring committee one or several interviews are scheduled for those remaining candidates ,Relevant
Interviews include Early interviews are typically one on one in person interviews between the applicants and the hiring manager ,Irrelevant
Early interviews conversations typically focus on applicants experience skills work history and availability ,Irrelevant
Additional interviews with management staff executives and other members of the organization can be either one on one or group interviews with the hiring committee ,Irrelevant
They may be formal or casual on site off site or online via Skype Google Hangouts etc ,Irrelevant
Additional interviews are more in depth for example in interviews between a candidate and multiple members of the hiring team interviewer each member of the hiring team focuses on a specific topic or aspect of the job to avoid redundancy and ensure an in depth conversation about the role and the candidates qualifications and experience ,Irrelevant
Note at this stage you should also inform the candidates you elect not to request an interview that the search has moved forward and they are no longer under consideration ,Relevant
Final interviews often include conversations with the company s senior leadership or a more in depth discussion with an interviewer from an earlier stage in the hiring process ,Irrelevant
Final interviews are typically extended only to a very small pool of top candidates ,Irrelevant
Once the interviews are completed or during their completion company s often assign applicants one or more standardized tests ,Relevant
These exams measure a wide range of variables including personality traits problem solving ability reasoning reading comprehension emotional intelligence and more ,Irrelevant
Your initial job posting should indicate that all candidates are subject to a background check ,Relevant
Background checks review candidates criminal record verify employment history and eligibility and run credit checks ,Irrelevant
Some organizations also check social media accounts Facebook Twitter etc to make sure potential employees are likely to represent the company in a professional manner ,Relevant
Drug testing may also be warranted depending on the position ,Relevant
After conducting background and reference checks the hiring staff identifies their top choice ,Relevant
The hiring staff should also select a backup candidate in case the top choice declines the offer or negotiations fail to produce a signed offer letter ,Relevant
In the event that no candidates meet the hiring criteria the hiring staff should determine whether or not to start the hiring process over ,Relevant
If so the hiring staff should discuss whether or not to adjust or alter the hiring process in order to yield more favorable candidates ,Relevant
Reference checks should verify any pertinent information shared by the candidate about previous employment job performance experience responsibilities workplace conduct etc ,Relevant
A typical question to ask references is Would you rehire this person? Once a top candidate is identified the organization should extend an initial offer ,Irrelevant
The offer letter should include the position s salary benefits paid time off start date potential severance pay working remotely policy included company equipment and other terms and conditions of employment ,Irrelevant
Negotiations are likely to follow ,Irrelevant
Therefore the hiring staff should determine internally which elements of the offer letter are negotiable and which are not ,Relevant
It is typical for terms like salary flexible work schedule and working remotely to be negotiable ,Irrelevant
After negotiations once the candidate accepts the job offer they are hired ,Relevant
An accepted offer letter begins a process of filling out and filing paperwork related to employment ,Relevant
Forms and paperwork might include Form W 4 Form I 9 and E Verify State Withholding and Registrations A checklist with all required paperwork to be completed by new employees An organization s employee handbook Hiring a new employee does not conclude the hiring process ,Irrelevant
Onboarding your new worker in a welcoming and professional way will help integrate them in a manner that lays the groundwork for a long term productive relationship between them and your company ,Relevant
A welcome letter is strongly advised ,Irrelevant
From there relevant management should reach out to the employee before their start date to welcome them to the organization ,Relevant
Their work space should be prepared cleaned and equipped with the necessary credentials and equipment before their first day ,Relevant
If an orientation is part of the onboarding process make sure your employee has a clear understanding of the expectations and scheduling of those events ,Relevant
Lastly consider assigning your new employee a mentor which will help them settle in to their new position and organization and set them up for long term growth and success ,Relevant
A document management system acts as the corners stone for indexing storing routing and approving invoices ,Irrelevant
Utilising a document management system provides the foundation for an efficient invoice approval process ,Irrelevant
Invoices can arrive in your organisation through the postal system email attachments or even still through fax ,Relevant
Invoices can be compiled in a document management system from multiple sources by importing directly from a scanner storing directly from an email client or automatically pulling the invoices from a file folder ,Relevant
Once the invoices are in a document management trayrather than paper in a tray on your desk the documents can then be indexed with the associated data such as supplier name invoice number etc ,Relevant
Through machine learning this indexing becomes automatically extracted and prepopulates index fields reducing the need for manually keying in of data ,Irrelevant
When the necessary indexing has been approved by a member of the accounts team the team member can then take responsibility to route invoices to relevant approvers ,Relevant
Defined invoices can automatically be routed to approvers based on business rules to eliminate the need for manual routing ,Relevant
When an invoice requires attention approvers can receive an email alert and in app notification accessible via mobile tablet or computer ,Relevant
Invoices with corresponding purchase orders can be automatically flagged as approved to pay ,Relevant
Approvers can view invoices within a browser based app on any device approve the invoices in full or part amount add notes reject or re route the invoice all configurable based on business rules ,Relevant
Approved invoices are routed back to the accounts team alerted by email or in app notifications ,Relevant
Invoices are then booked for payment ,Relevant
The invoices have been indexed approved and stored in the document management system they are easily searchable and accessible ,Irrelevant
Related documents can be displayed at the click of a mouse ,Irrelevant
Desired information can be exported to any accounting system with information able to travel both ways through intelligent integration ,Irrelevant
Important data such as if an invoice has been paid from your accounting system back into the document management system to close the loop on the invoice process ,Irrelevant
Organisations can gain valuable insights by utilising the ability to run multiple reports on approval times invoice volumes and department performance and other desired metrics ,Irrelevant
The business receives an invoice from a vendor or supplier ,Relevant
The invoice is verified by the staff member responsible for procuring that particular type of product or service ,Relevant
Verification typically involves matching the invoice with the appropriate purchase order PO for the product or service ,Irrelevant
Invoice irregularities can include pricing discrepancies and missing information such as a PO number ,Irrelevant
The invoice is sent to the relevant parties to address correct the irregularity after which it s sent through the approval workflow again ,Relevant
The invoice is sent to relevant personnel for approval ,Relevant
Depending on the products and services being ordered or the billed amount this approval chain can be dynamically determined ,Irrelevant
The approved invoice is sent to the person department responsible for accounts payable for processing and the vendor is paid ,Relevant
A permanent record of the transaction is added to the organization s books ,Relevant
That s it  the whole process in six quick steps ,Irrelevant
The invoice approval process may seem simple but multiply this by dozens or hundreds of vendors and thousands of invoices and you quickly have a complex situation on your hands ,Irrelevant
The user will be prompted to input the Process Name Unique Name and an optional short description ,Relevant
Then the Specify Entry Criteria step allows the user to define criteria that need to be met for the approval process to take place ,Relevant
Choose Criteria are met to set filter criteria that records should meet to trigger and enter the approval process ,Irrelevant
Add the filter criteria on the fields provided ,Relevant
Leave the filter blank if all the records in there will be included in the process ,Relevant
Choose Formula Evaluates to True if a formula will be required to determine the records that will enter in the process ,Relevant
Click on New field update email task select Conditions and click on Save ,Relevant
Define Approval Steps Here the current user can assign approval requests to several other users through an automatic user field ,Relevant
Bear in mind that the administrator has the sole responsibility to edit the process ,Irrelevant
Enter the condition for approval of the records then save ,Relevant
The administrator can edit this anytime ,Irrelevant
Enter the default actions or conditions that will lead to rejection ,Relevant
After this step the process will be automatically activated ,Relevant
Hence no more additional steps can be added or changed ,Irrelevant
Preapproval is as close as you can get to confirming your creditworthiness without having a purchase contract in place ,Irrelevant
You will complete a mortgage application and the lender will verify the information you provide ,Relevant
They ll also perform a credit check ,Relevant
If you re preapproved you ll receive a preapproval letter which is an offer but not a commitment to lend you a specific amount good for 90 days ,Relevant
An insurance claim is a formal request by a policyholder to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event ,Irrelevant
The insurance company validates or denies the claim ,Relevant
If it is approved the insurance company will issue payment to the insured or an approved interested party on behalf of the insured ,Relevant
Your customer buys an item on your site with a credit or debit card ,Relevant
That information goes through the payment gateway which encrypts the data to keep it private and sends it to the payment processor ,Relevant
The payment processor sends a request to the customer s issuing bank to check to see that they have enough credit to pay for your stuff ,Relevant
The issuer responds with a yes an approval or a no a denial ,Relevant
The payment processor sends the answer back to you that the sale was approved and also tells your merchant bank to credit your account ,Relevant
The buyer validates the shopping cart ,Relevant
The merchant website redirects the buyer to the payment gateway ,Relevant
This redirection is done via an HTML POST form in HTTPS ,Irrelevant
The parameters of the form are described in the chapter Generating a payment form ,Irrelevant
When the parameters and their signature have been verified the payment method selection page appears ,Relevant
If the payment method has been specified in the form the buyer moves on directly to step 6 ,Relevant
The buyer selects a payment method ,Relevant
The buyer clicks Validate ,Relevant
The buyer enters the number and the expiry date of their card ,Relevant
If the card has a security CVV code it must be specified ,Relevant
During a payment by CB card co branded VISA or MASTERCARD the buyer chooses the logo of the brand he or she wishes to use for the payment ,Relevant
The payment gateway automatically detects the brand s associated with the number of the used card ,Relevant
If several brands are available a drop down list will appear to the right of the entry field ,Relevant
The logo chosen by the merchant will appear first on the list ,Relevant
If only one brand is available the logo will appear automatically ,Relevant
If you need help you can click the ? icon to the right of the entry field ,Relevant
He or she and confirms the entry by clicking Validate ,Relevant
If the merchant and the buyer s card are enrolled in the 3D Secure program the payment will be authenticated with 3D Secure ,Relevant
An authorization request is sent to the buyer s bank the issuer in addition to internal fraud verification on the payment gateway ,Relevant
In case of success a summary page is presented to the buyer with a summary of transaction details ,Relevant
The logo of the brand selected by the buyer will appear on the receipt ,Relevant
A button allowing to return to the shop is presented ,Relevant
In case of failure a message is displayed ,Relevant
The buyer is informed of the rejection of the payment request ,Relevant
A button allowing to cancel and return to the shop is presented ,Relevant
If you have configured a number of additional attempts that is higher than 0 in your Merchant Back Office the buyer will be able to retry to finalize their payment ,Relevant
If he or she accepts the payment process resumes at the stage of payment method selection ,Relevant
Once the additional attempts have been used the payment is permanently rejected ,Relevant
When a supplier payment needs to be generated the recording of the invoice received from the supplier or other payment request documentation such as a check request is approved and entered as an invoice into the accounts payable module in Oracle ,Relevant
Invoices can be entered prior to the date the check is to be produced ,Relevant
Based on the payment terms entered for example Immediate Net 30 the invoice is selected to be included in the payment process which is done overnight by RF central office ,Relevant
The payment process generates the check ,Relevant
Generally the floor pan is the largest body component to which a multitude of panels and braces will subsequently be either welded or bolted ,Irrelevant
As it moves down the assembly line held in place by clamping fixtures the shell of the vehicle is built ,Irrelevant
First the left and right quarter panels are robotically disengaged from pre staged shipping containers and placed onto the floor pan where they are stabilized with positioning fixtures and welded ,Relevant
The front and rear door pillars roof and body side panels are assembled in the same fashion ,Relevant
The shell of the automobile assembled in this section of the process lends itself to the use of robots because articulating arms can easily introduce various component braces and panels to the floor pan and perform a high number of weld operations in a time frame and with a degree of accuracy no human workers could ever approach ,Relevant
Robots can pick and load 200 pound 90 8 kilograms roof panels and place them precisely in the proper weld position with tolerance variations held to within 001 of an inch ,Irrelevant
Moreover robots can also tolerate thesmoke weld flashes and gases created during this phase of production ,Irrelevant
As the body moves from the isolated weld area of the assembly line subsequent body components including fully assembled doors deck lids hood panel fenders trunk lid and bumper reinforcements are installed ,Relevant
Although robots help workers place these components onto the body shell the workers provide the proper fit for most of the bolt on functional parts using pneumatically assisted tools ,Relevant
Manufacturers first clean the beans to remove unwanted material ,Relevant
Next they roast and winnow the beans to obtain the edible part called nib which is the edible part of the bean ,Relevant
Thereafter they melt the nib and add sugar and flavor to it ,Relevant
The liquid chocolate so produced is either stored or molded into the required solid form ,Relevant
The process of making chocolate starts with the cocoa beans being passed through a machine that removes dried cocoa pulp pieces of pod and other extraneous material ,Relevant
The beans are carefully weighed and blended according to specifications ,Relevant
Finally the last vestiges of wood jute fibres sand and even the finest dust are extracted by powerful vacuum equipment ,Relevant
The separated cocoa bean husks are passed on to the chemical industry which extracts valuable compounds ,Relevant
To bring out the characteristic chocolate aroma the beans are roasted in large rotary cylinders ,Relevant
Depending upon the variety of the beans and the desired end result the roasting lasts from 30 minutes to two hours at temperatures of 250 degrees Fahrenheit and higher ,Relevant
As the beans turn over and over their moisture content drops their color changes to a rich brown and the characteristic aroma of chocolate becomes evident ,Irrelevant
Although all steps are important proper roasting is one of the keys to good flavor ,Irrelevant
The cocoa beans are cooled quickly and their thin shells which have become brittle by roasting are removed ,Relevant
A giant winnowing machine that passes the beans between serrated cones so they are cracked rather than crushed ,Relevant
In the process a series of mechanical sieves separate the broken pieces into large and small grains while fans blow away the thin light shell from the meat or nibs ,Relevant
Here s where the first secrets of the chocolate manufacturer comes in ,Irrelevant
The nibs are blended combining as many as 8 10 varieties ,Relevant
It is control of these subtle mixtures that maintain constant quality and brings out the flavor of each particular variety of chocolate ,Irrelevant
The nibs which contain about 53 % cocoa butter pass through refining mills and are ground between large grinding stones or heavy steel discs creating a cocoa paste ,Relevant
The paste is subjected to hydraulic pressure and the cocoa butter flowing out is a pure and valuable fat with a marked aroma after filtering and purifying it looks very much like ordinary butter ,Relevant
To make cocoa powder chocolate liquor is pumped into hydraulic presses weighing up to 25 tons and when the pressure is applied 80% cocoa butter is removed ,Relevant
The fat drains away through metallic screens as a yellow liquid and then is collected for use in chocolate manufacturing ,Relevant
Cocoa butter unique among vegetable fats is a solid at normal room temperature and melts at 89 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit just below body temperature ,Irrelevant
With proper storage conditions cocoa butter can be kept for years without spoiling ,Irrelevant
The cake which is left may eventually be made into cocoa powder by being further crushed milled and finely sifted ,Irrelevant
Three or five vertically mounted steel rollers rotate in opposite directions ,Irrelevant
Under heavy pressure they pulverize the tiny particles of cocoa and sugar down to a size of approx 30 microns One micron is a thousandth part of a millimeter  Milk chocolate is made by adding milk sugar cocoa butter and other ingredients to the bitter chocolate liquor ,Relevant
At this point Chocolate is prepared in according to individual recipes ,Irrelevant
The blending of the various types of cocoa pastes and other ingredients determine the ultimate taste ,Irrelevant
The ingredients go into a mixer with rotating kneading arms until the result is a homogeneous paste like mixture with a pleasant taste but it still feels gritty to the palate ,Relevant
Conching machines knead the Chocolate Paste ,Relevant
This process develops flavors and changes the texture during controlled temperatures ,Irrelevant
It s the last and most important refining process which allows the separate flavors of the individual ingredients to combine ,Irrelevant
Conches [the paddles of the early machines resembled conch shells] are equipped with heavy rollers that plow back and forth through the chocolate paste anywhere from a few hours to several days ,Irrelevant
Contemporary technologies can grind the chocolate particles extremely fine which can reduce conching times ,Irrelevant
Swiss and Belgian chocolates are conched as much as 96 hours ,Irrelevant
Some chocolates are not conched at all or for only 4 to 12 hours ,Irrelevant
Under regulated speeds and temperatures these rollers can produce different degrees of agitation and aeration to create distinct chocolate flavors ,Relevant
The process can eliminate any remaining bitterness by aerating the chocolate and expelling volatile acids ,Irrelevant
Additional cocoa butter and lecithin are added which help to achieve the characteristic velvet smoothness ,Relevant
And as the ultimate homogeneity of the ingredients is developed a soft film of cocoa butter begins to form around each of the extremely small particles ,Relevant
The chocolate no longer seems sandy but dissolves meltingly on the tongue ,Irrelevant
It has attained the outstanding purity which gives it its reputation ,Irrelevant
The last stage of conching Swiss or Belgian chocolate is a magnificent sight huge paddles rolling slowly through great vats of chocolate smooth and creamy and thick ,Relevant
Circular conches use a rotary movement and can hold 9 tons of chocolate ,Irrelevant
They are the most efficient of the conch machines In some manufacturing setups there is an emulsifying operation that either takes the place of conching [or supplements conching] ,Relevant
Emulsifying is breaking up sugar crystals and other particles in the chocolate mixture to give it a fine velvety smoothness ,Irrelevant
The machine works like an eggbeater ,Irrelevant
Chocolate is Tempered by Heating Cooling   Reheating This thickens the chocolate and imparts the right flow properties for filling the moulds ,Relevant
This complex operation is performed in the tempering plant and is necessary to give the final chocolate product a delicate composition a uniform structure and a well rounded flavor ,Irrelevant
The storage life is also increased in this way ,Irrelevant
The still warm conched chocolate is placed in a tempering machine so that it can be slowly and steadily cooled ,Relevant
Cooling chocolate at a fixed rate keeps the flavor from being compromised and prevents separation when the chocolate is poured into bar molds ,Irrelevant
Proper tempering also results in a silky sheen and crisp snap when broken another sign of a superior quality chocolate bar ,Irrelevant
The tempered chocolate is poured into molds of many sizes from individual sized bars to a ten pound blocks used by confectionery manufacturers ,Relevant
Liquid Chocolate is Temporary Stored A necessary step conches are always filled with the largest amounts of chocolate for efficiency the molding machines can only accept small amounts of chocolate paste at one time in order to shape it into bars chocolates and other products ,Relevant
Chocolate is frequently shipped in a liquid state to other food manufacturers or it can be stored for short periods of time ,Relevant
For longer periods it is solidified usually in the form of hundredweight blocks ,Relevant
These blocks must be reheated before further processing so that they liquefy again ,Irrelevant
The cocoa beans are cleaned to remove all extraneous material ,Relevant
To bring out the chocolate flavour and colour the beans are roasted ,Relevant
The temperature time and degree of moisture involved in roasting depend on the type of beans used and the sort of chocolate or product required from the process ,Irrelevant
A winnowing machine is used to remove the shells from the beans to leave just the cocoa nibs ,Relevant
The cocoa nibs undergo alkalisation usually with potassium carbonate to develop the flavour and colour ,Relevant
The nibs are then milled to create cocoa liquor cocoa particles suspended in cocoa butter ,Relevant
The temperature and degree of milling varies according to the type of nib used and the product required ,Irrelevant
Manufacturers generally use more than one type of bean in their products and therefore the different beans have to be blended together to the required formula ,Relevant
The cocoa liquor is pressed to extract the cocoa butter leaving a solid mass called cocoa presscake ,Relevant
The amount of butter extracted from the liquor is controlled by the manufacturer to produce presscake with different proportions of fat ,Relevant
The processing now takes two different directions ,Irrelevant
The cocoa butter is used in the manufacture of chocolate ,Irrelevant
The cocoa presscake is broken into small pieces to form kibbled presscake which is then pulverised to form cocoa powder ,Relevant
Cocoa liquor is used to produce chocolate through the addition of cocoa butter ,Relevant
Other ingredients such as sugar milk emulsifying agents and cocoa butter equivalents are also added and mixed ,Relevant
The proportions of the different ingredients depend on the type of chocolate being made ,Irrelevant
The mixture then undergoes a refining process by travelling through a series of rollers until a smooth paste is formed ,Relevant
Refining improves the texture of the chocolate ,Irrelevant
The next process conching further develops flavour and texture ,Relevant
Conching is a kneading or smoothing process ,Irrelevant
The speed duration and temperature of the kneading affect the flavour ,Irrelevant
An alternative to conching is an emulsifying process using a machine that works like an egg beater ,Irrelevant
The mixture is then tempered or passed through a heating cooling and reheating process ,Relevant
This prevents discolouration and fat bloom in the product by preventing certain crystalline formations of cocoa butter developing ,Irrelevant
The mixture is then put into moulds or used for enrobing fillings and cooled in a cooling chamber ,Relevant
The chocolate is then packaged for distribution to retail outlets ,Relevant
Whole corn kernels are ground into a form of flour ormeal ,Relevant
The meal is mainly starch ,Irrelevant
Astarchis acarbohydratemade up of long chains of sugar molecules ,Irrelevant
Liquefaction Water is added to the meal to make slurry ,Relevant
The slurry is heated to break the long starch molecules into smaller pieces ,Relevant
Theenzymealpha amylase is added tocatalyzeor speed up the breakdown of the starch molecules ,Relevant
Saccharification Starch molecule pieces are broken down into the simple sugarglucose ,Relevant
This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called glucoamylase ,Relevant
Fermentation Single celled microorganisms calledyeastare added to the slurry ,Relevant
Fermentation is the biochemical process that occurs when yeast break down glucose ,Irrelevant
Yeast gets energy from glucose ,Irrelevant
As a result ethanol is produced ,Relevant
Distillation and Dehydration The product of the fermentation process is only 10 15% ethanol ,Irrelevant
It must beconcentratedto become pure 100% ethanol ,Irrelevant
Ethanol has a lowerboiling pointthan water ,Irrelevant
It is selectivelyevaporatedandcondensedin a process calleddistillation ,Relevant
This process produces ethanol that is 95% pure ,Irrelevant
The remaining 5% of the mixture is water ,Irrelevant
The mixture is strained anddehydratedto produce pure ethanol ,Relevant
Denaturation A small amount of gasoline is added to fuel ethanol to make it undrinkable ,Relevant
Most ethanol is produced using a four step process ? ,Irrelevant
The ethanol feedstock crops or plants are ground up for easier processing ,Relevant
Sugar is dissolved from the ground material or the starch or cellulose is converted into sugar ,Relevant
This is done through a cooking process ,Irrelevant
Microbes such as yeast or bacteria feed on the sugar producing ethanolin a process called fermentation essentially the same way beer and wine are made ,Irrelevant
Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of this fermentation ,Irrelevant
The ethanol is distilled to achieve a high concentration ,Relevant
Gasoline or another additive is added so it cannot be consumed by humans a process calleddenaturation ,Relevant
This way the ethanol also avoids a tax on beverage alcohol ,Irrelevant
The sifted flour is poured into an industrial mixer ,Relevant
Temperature controlled wateris piped into the mixer ,Relevant
This mixture is called gluten and gives bread its elasticity ,Irrelevant
A pre measured amount of yeast is added ,Relevant
Yeast is actually a tiny organism which feeds off the sugars in the grain and emits carbon dioxide ,Irrelevant
The growth of the yeast produces gas bubbles which leaven the bread ,Irrelevant
Depending on the type of bread to be made other ingredients are also poured into the mixer ,Relevant
Modern mixers can process up to 2 000 pounds 908 kg of dough per minute ,Irrelevant
The mixer is essentially an enclosed drum that rotates at speeds between 35 to 75 revolutions per minute ,Irrelevant
Inside the drum mechanical arms knead the dough to the desired consistency in a matter of seconds ,Relevant
Although modern bread production is highly computerized the ability of the mixing staff to judge the elasticity and appearance of the dough is critical ,Irrelevant
Experienced personnel will be able to determine the consistency by the sound of the dough as it rolls around the mixer ,Irrelevant
The mixing process takes about 12 minutes ,Irrelevant
Three methods are used to ferment the dough ,Irrelevant
In some plants the high speed machinery is designed to manipulate the dough at extreme speeds and with great force which forces the yeast cells to rapidly multiply ,Irrelevant
Fermentation can also be induced by the addition of chemical additives such as 1 cysteine a naturally occurring amino acid and vitamin C ,Relevant
Some breads are allowed to ferment naturally ,Irrelevant
In this instance the dough is placed in covered metal bowls and stored in a temperature controlled room until it rises ,Relevant
After the dough has fermented it is loaded into a divider with rotating blades that cut the dough into pre determined weights ,Relevant
A conveyer belt then moves the pieces of dough to a molding machine ,Relevant
The molding machine shapes the dough into balls and drops them onto a layered conveyer belt that is enclosed in a warm humid cabinet called a prover ,Relevant
The dough moves slowly through the prover so that it may rest and so that the gas reproduction may progress ,Relevant
When the dough emerges from the prover it is conveyed to a second molding machine which re shapes the dough into loaves and drops them into pans ,Relevant
The pans travel to another prover that is set at a high temperature and with a high level of humidity ,Relevant
Here the dough regains the elasticity lost during fermentation and the resting period ,Irrelevant
From the prover the pans enter a tunnel oven ,Relevant
The temperature and speed are carefully calculated so that when the loaves emerge from the tunnel they are completely baked and partially cooled ,Irrelevant
While inside the tunnel the loaves are mechanically dumped from the pans onto shelves ,Relevant
The baking and cooling process lasts approximately 30 minutes ,Irrelevant
The bread continues to cool as it moves from the oven to the slicing machine ,Relevant
Here vertical serrated blades move up and down at great speeds slicing the bread into consistently sized pieces ,Relevant
Metal plates hold the slices together while picking up each loaf and passing it to the wrapping machine ,Relevant
Pre printed plastic bags are mechanically slipped over each loaf ,Relevant
At some bakeries workers close the bags with wire twists ,Relevant
Other plants seal the bags with heat ,Relevant
The procedure for manufacturing hard aspirin tablets known asdry granulationorslugging is as follows ,Irrelevant
The corn starch the active ingredient and the lubricant are weighed separately in sterile canisters to determine if the ingredients meet pre determined specifications for the batch size and dosage amount ,Relevant
The corn starch is dispensed into cold purified water then heated and stirred until a translucent paste forms ,Relevant
The corn starch the active ingredient and part of the lubricant are next poured into one sterile canister and the canister is wheeled to a mixing machine called a Glen Mixer ,Relevant
Mixing blends the ingredients as well as expels air from the mixture ,Relevant
The mixture is then mechanically separated into units which are generally from 7 8 to 1 inches 2 22 to 2 54 centimeters in size ,Relevant
These units are calledslugs ,Irrelevant
Next small batches of slugs are forced through a mesh screen by a hand heldstainless steelspatula ,Relevant
Large batches in sizable manufacturing outlets are filtered through a machine called a Fitzpatrick mill ,Relevant
The remaining lubricant is added to the mixture which is blended gently in a rotary granulator and sifter ,Relevant
The lubricant keeps the mixture from sticking to the tablet machine during the compression process ,Irrelevant
The mixture is compressed into tablets either by a single punch machine for small batches or a rotary tablet machine for large scale production ,Relevant
The majority of single punch machines are power driven but hand operated models are still available ,Irrelevant
On single punch machines the mixture is fed into one tablet mold called a dye cavity by a feed shoe as follows ,Relevant
The feed shoe passes over the dye cavity and releases the mixture ,Relevant
The feed shoe then retracts and scrapes all excess mixture away from the dye cavity ,Relevant
A puncha short steel rodthe size of the dye cavity descends into the dye compressing the mixture into a tablet ,Relevant
The punch then retracts while a punch belowthe dye cavity rises into the cavity and ejects the tablet ,Relevant
As the feed shoe returns to fill the dye cavity again it pushes the compressed tablet from the dye platform ,Relevant
On rotary tablet machines the mixture runs through a feed line into a number of dye cavities which are situated on a large steel plate ,Relevant
The plate revolves as the mixture is dispensed through the feed line rapidly filling each dye cavity ,Relevant
Punches both above and below the dye cavities rotate in sequence with the rotation of the dye cavities ,Relevant
Rollers on top of the upper punches press the punches down onto the dye cavities compressing the mixture into tablets while roller activated punches beneath the dye cavities lift up and eject the tablets from the dye platform ,Relevant
The compressed tablets are subjected to a tablet hardness and friability test as well as a tablet disintegration test see Quality Control section below ,Relevant
The tablets are transferred to an automated bottling assembly line where they are dispensed into clear or color coated polyethylene or polypropylene plastic bottles or glass bottles ,Relevant
The bottles are topped with cotton packing sealed with a sheer aluminum top and then sealed with a plastic and rubber child proof lid ,Relevant
A sheer round plastic band is then affixed to the circular edge of the lid ,Relevant
It serves as an additional seal to discourage and detect product tampering ,Irrelevant
The bottles are then labeled with product information and an expiration date is affixed ,Relevant
Depending on the manufacturer the bottles are then packaged in individual cardboard boxes ,Relevant
The packages or bottles are then boxed in larger cardboard boxes in preparation for distribution to distributors ,Relevant
The raw materials are carefully weighed in the appropriate amounts and mixed together with a small amount of water to prevent segregation of the ingredients ,Relevant
Cullet broken waste glass is also used as a raw material ,Irrelevant
Once the batch is made it is fed to a large tank for melting using the floatglass process ,Relevant
First the batch is heated to a molten state and then it is fed into a tank called the float chamber which holds a bath of molten tin ,Relevant
The float chamber is very largefrom about 13 feet to 26 25 feet 4 to 8 meters wide and up to almost 197 feet 60 meters long at its entrance the temperature of the tin is about 1 835 degrees Fahrenheit 1 000 degrees Celsius while at the exit the tin s temperature is slightly cooler1 115 degrees Fahrenheit 600 degrees Celsius ,Irrelevant
In the float chamber the glass doesn t submerge into the tin but floats on top of it moving through the tank as though on a conveyor belt ,Relevant
The perfectly flat surface of the tin causes the molten glass also to become flat while the high temperatures clean the glass of impurities ,Irrelevant
The decreased temperature at the exit of the chamber allows the glass to harden enough to move into the next chamber a furnace ,Relevant
After the glass exits from the float chamber rollers pick it up and feed it into a special furnace called a lehr ,Relevant
If any solar coatings are desired they are applied before the glass enters the lehr ,Relevant
In this furnace the glass is cooled gradually to about 395 degrees Fahrenheit 200 degrees Celsius after the glass exits the lehr it cools to room temperature ,Relevant
It is now very hard and strong and ready to be cut ,Irrelevant
The glass is cut into the desired dimensions using a diamond scribea tool with sharp metal points containing diamond dust ,Relevant
Diamond is used because it is harder than glass ,Irrelevant
The scribe marks a cut line into the glass which is then broken or snapped at this line ,Relevant
This step is usually automated and is monitored by cameras and optoelectronic measuring systems ,Irrelevant
Next the cut piece must be bent into shape ,Irrelevant
The sheet of glass is placed into a form or mold of metal or refractory material ,Relevant
The glass filled mold is then heated in a furnace to the point where the glass sags to the shape of the mold ,Relevant
After this shaping step the glass must be hardened in a heating step called tempering ,Irrelevant
The glass is quickly heated to about 1 565 degrees Fahrenheit 850 degrees Celsius and then it is blasted with jets of cold air ,Relevant
Called quenching this process toughens the glass by putting the outer surface into compression and the inside into tension ,Relevant
This allows the windshield when damaged to break into many small pieces of glass without sharp edges ,Irrelevant
The size of the pieces can also be changed by modifying the tempering procedure so that the windshield breaks into larger pieces allowing good vision until the wind shield can be replaced ,Irrelevant
After the glass is tempered and cleaned it goes through a laminating process ,Relevant
In this process two sheets of glass are bonded together with a layer of plastic the plastic layer goes inside the two glass sheets ,Relevant
The lamination takes place in an autoclave a special oven that uses both heat and pressure to form a single strong unit that is resistant to tearing ,Relevant
The plastic interlayer is often tinted to act as an ultraviolet filter ,Irrelevant
When laminated glass is broken the broken pieces of glass remain bound to the internal tear resistant plastic layer and the broken sheet remains transparent ,Relevant
Thus visibility remains good ,Irrelevant
Unlike traditional safety glass laminated glass can be further processedcut drilled and edge worked as necessary ,Irrelevant
A typical laminated windshield is very thin each glass layer is approximately 03 inch 76 millimeter thick while the plastic interlayer is approximately 098 inch 25 millimeters thick ,Irrelevant
After laminating the windshield is ready to be assembled with plastic moldings so it can be installed on the car ,Relevant
Known as glass encapsulation this assembly process is usually done at the glass manufacturer ,Irrelevant
First the peripheral section of the windshield is set in a predetermined position in a mold cavity ,Relevant
Next molten plastic is injected into the mold when it cools it forms a plastic frame around the glass ,Relevant
The windshield assembly is then shipped to the car manufacturer where it is installed in an automobile ,Relevant
The installation is done by direct glazing a process that uses a polyurethane adhesive to bond the windshield and automobile body ,Relevant
Soda ash can be manufactured chemically using the Solvay process or it can be made from trona ore ,Irrelevant
If trona ore is used it must first be mined ,Relevant
After it has been brought to the surface the trona ore is transported to a variety of processing plants ,Relevant
There the ore is refined into a slurry of sodium sesquicarbonate an intermediate soda ash product that actually contains both soda ash sodium carbonate and baking soda sodium bicarbonate ,Relevant
Next the intermediate soda ash solution is put into a centrifuge which separates the liquid from the crystals ,Relevant
The crystals are then dissolved in a bicarbonate solution a soda ash solution made by the manufacturer in a rotary dissolver thereby becoming a saturated solution ,Relevant
This solution is filtered to remove any non soluble materials and is then pumped through a feed tank to the top of a carbonating tower ,Relevant
Purified carbon dioxide is introduced into the bottom of the tower and held under pressure ,Relevant
As the saturated sodium solution moves through the tower it cools and reacts with the carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate crystals ,Relevant
These crystals are collected at the bottom of the tower and transferred to another centrifuge where excess solution filtrate is filtered out ,Relevant
The crystals are then washed in a bicarbonate solution forming a cake like substance ready for drying ,Relevant
The filtrate that is removed from the centrifuge is recycled to the rotary dissolver where it is used to saturate more intermediate soda ash crystals ,Relevant
The washed filter cake is then dried on either a continuous belt conveyor or in a vertical tube drier called aflash dryer ,Relevant
The theoretical yield from the process according to the Church   Dwight Company is between 90 and 95 percent and the baking soda manufactured is more than 99 percent pure ,Irrelevant
Next the dried crystals of sodium bicarbonate are separated into various grades by particle size ,Relevant
Standard grades of sodium bicarbonate and special grades are manufactured to meet customers specific requirements and particle size is the major determinant of grades ,Irrelevant
Powdered #1 and fine granular #2 have a wide range of uses in foods chemicals and pharmaceuticals ,Irrelevant
Granular grades #4 and #5 are found in foods and doughnuts cleaning compounds pharmaceuticals and many other products ,Irrelevant
Industrial grade sodium bicarbonate is used in diverse applications including oil well drilling fluids fire extinguishing materials and water treatment ,Irrelevant
Each grade goes to a holding bin wherein atmosphere carbon dioxide and moisture content are controlled to cure the product ,Relevant
Once cured the grades are ready to be packaged and shipped ,Relevant
There are four major parts to a standard ball bearing the outer race the rolling balls the inner race and the cage ,Irrelevant
Both races are made in almost the same way ,Irrelevant
Since they are both rings of steel the process starts with steel tubing of an appropriate size ,Relevant
Automatic machines similar to lathes use cutting tools to cut the basic shape of the race leaving all of the dimensions slightly too large ,Relevant
The reason for leaving them too large is that the races must be heat treated before being finished and the steelusually warps during this process ,Irrelevant
They can be machined back to their finished size after heat treating ,Irrelevant
The rough cut races are put into a heat treating furnace at about 1 550 degrees Fahrenheit 843 degrees Celsius for up to several hours depending on the size of the parts then dipped into an oil bath to cool them and make them very hard ,Relevant
This hardening also makes them brittle so the next step is to temper them ,Relevant
This is done by heating them in a second oven to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit 148 8 degrees Celsius and then letting them cool in air ,Relevant
This whole heat treatment process makes parts which are both hard and tough ,Irrelevant
After the heat treatment process the races are ready for finishing ,Irrelevant
However the races are now too hard to cut with cutting tools so the rest of the work must be done withgrinding wheels ,Irrelevant
These are a lot like what you would find in any shop for sharpening drill bits and tools except that several different kinds and shapes are needed to finish the races ,Irrelevant
Almost every place on the race is finished by grinding which leaves a very smooth accurate surface ,Relevant
The surfaces where the bearing fits into the machine must be very round and the sides must be flat ,Irrelevant
The surface that the balls roll on is ground first and then lapped ,Relevant
This means that a very fine abrasive slurry is used to polish the races for several hours to get almost a mirror finish ,Relevant
At this point the races are finished and ready to be put together with the balls ,Relevant
The balls are a little more difficult to make even though their shape is very simple ,Irrelevant
Surprisingly the balls start out as thick wire ,Relevant
This wire is fed from a roll into a machine that cuts off a short piece and then smashes both ends in toward the middle ,Relevant
This process is called cold heading ,Irrelevant
Its name comes from the fact that the wire is notheated before being smashed and that the original use for the process was to put the heads on nails which is still how that is done ,Irrelevant
At any rate the balls now look like the planet Saturn with a ring around the middle called flash ,Irrelevant
The first machining process removes this flash ,Relevant
The ball bearings are put between the faces of two cast iron disks where they ride in grooves ,Relevant
The inside of the grooves are rough which tears the flash off of the balls ,Relevant
One wheel rotates while the other one stays still ,Irrelevant
The stationary wheel has holes through it so that the balls can be fed into and taken out of the grooves ,Irrelevant
A special conveyor feeds balls into one hole the balls rattle around the groove and then come out the other hole ,Relevant
They are then fed back into the conveyor for many trips through the wheel grooves until they have been cut down to being fairly round almost to the proper size and the flash is completely gone ,Relevant
Once again the balls are left oversize so that they can be ground to their finished size after heat treatment ,Relevant
The amount of steel left for finishing is not much only about 8 1000 of an inch 02 centimeter which is about as thick as two sheets of paper ,Irrelevant
The heat treatment process for the balls is similar to that used for the races since the kind of steel is the same and it is best to have all the parts wear at about the same rate ,Irrelevant
Like the races the balls become hard and tough after heat treating and tempering ,Irrelevant
After heat treatment the balls are put back into a machine that works the same way as the flash remover except that the wheels are grinding wheels instead of cutting wheels ,Relevant
These wheels grind the balls down so that they are round and within a few ten thousandths of an inch of their finished size ,Relevant
After this the balls are moved to a lapping machine which has cast iron wheels and uses the same abrasive lapping compound as is used on the races ,Relevant
Here they will be lapped for 8 10 hours depending onhow precise a bearing they are being made for ,Relevant
Once again the result is steel that is extremely smooth ,Irrelevant
Steel cages are stamped out of fairly thin sheet metal much like a cookie cutter and then bent to their final shape in a die ,Relevant
A die is made up of two pieces of steel that fit together with a hole the shape of the finished part carved inside ,Irrelevant
When the cage is put in between and the die is closed the cage is bent to the shape of the hole inside ,Relevant
The die is then opened and the finished part is taken out ready to be assembled ,Relevant
Plastic cages are usually made by a process called injection molding ,Irrelevant
In this process a hollow metal mold is filled by squirting melted plastic into it and letting it harden ,Relevant
The mold is opened up and the finished cage is taken out ready for assembly ,Relevant
Now that all of the parts are made the bearing needs to be put together ,Irrelevant
The inner race is put inside the outer race only off to one side as far as possible ,Relevant
This makes a space between them on the opposite side large enough to insert balls between them ,Irrelevant
The required number of balls is put in then the races are moved so that they are both centered and the balls distributed evenly around the bearing ,Relevant
At this point the cage is installed to hold the balls apart from each other ,Relevant
Plastic cages are usually just snapped in while steel cages usually have to be put in and riveted together ,Relevant
Now that the bearing is assembled it is coated with a rust preventative and packaged for shipping ,Relevant
Prior to painting the body must pass through a rigorous inspection process the body in white operation ,Irrelevant
The shell of the vehicle passes through a brightly lit white room where it is fully wiped down by visual inspectors using cloths soaked in hi light oil ,Relevant
Under the lights this oil allows inspectors to see any defects in the sheet metal body panels ,Irrelevant
Dings dents and any other defects are repaired right on the line by skilled body repairmen ,Relevant
After the shell has been fully inspected and repaired the assembly conveyor carries it through a cleaning station where it is immersed and cleaned of all residual oil dirt and contaminants ,Relevant
As the shell exits the cleaning station it goes through a drying booth and then through an undercoat dipan electrostatically charged bath of undercoat paint called the E coat that covers every nook and cranny of the body shell both inside and out with primer ,Relevant
This coat acts as a substrate surface to which the top coat of colored paint adheres ,Irrelevant
After the E coat bath the shell is again dried in a booth as it proceeds on to the final paint operation ,Relevant
In most automobile assembly plants today vehicle bodies are spray painted by robots that have been programmed to apply the exact amounts of paint to just the right areas for just the right length of time ,Irrelevant
Considerable research and programming has gone into the dynamics of robotic painting in order to ensure the fine wet finishes we have come to expect ,Irrelevant
Our robotic painters have come a long way since Ford s first Model Ts which were painted by hand with a brush ,Irrelevant
Once the shell has been fully covered 1 V with a base coat of color paint and a clear top coat the conveyor transfers the bodies through baking ovens where the paint is cured at temperatures exceeding 275 degrees Fahrenheit 135 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
The body and chassis assemblies are mated near the end of the production process ,Relevant
Robotic arms lift the body shell onto the chassis frame where human workers then bolt the two together ,Relevant
After final components are installed the vehicle is driven off the assembly line to a quality checkpoint ,Relevant
After the shell leaves the paint area it is ready for interior assembly ,Irrelevant
The painted shell proceeds through the interior assembly area where workers assemble all of the instrumentation and wiring systems dash panels interior lights seats door and trim panels headliners radios speakers all glass except theautomobile windshield steering column and wheel body weatherstrips vinyl tops brake and gas pedals carpeting and front and rear bumper fascias ,Relevant
Next robots equipped with suction cups remove the windshield from a shipping container apply a bead of urethane sealer to the perimeter of the glass and then place it into the body windshield frame ,Relevant
Robots also pick seats and trim panels and transport them to the vehicle for the ease and efficiency of the assembly operator ,Relevant
After passing through this section the shell is given a water test to ensure the proper fit of door panels glass and weatherstripping ,Relevant
It is now ready to mate with the chassis ,Irrelevant
The chassis assembly conveyor and the body shell conveyor meet at this stage of production ,Relevant
As the chassis passes the body conveyor the shell is robotically lifted from its conveyor fixtures and placed onto the car frame ,Relevant
Assembly workers some at ground level and some in work pits beneath the conveyor bolt the car body to the frame ,Relevant
Once the mating takes place the automobile proceeds down the line to receive final trim components battery tires anti freeze and gasoline ,Relevant
The vehicle can now be started ,Irrelevant
From here it is driven to a checkpoint off the line where its engine is audited its lights and horn checked its tires balanced and its charging system examined ,Relevant
Any defects discovered at this stage require that the car be taken to a central repair area usually located near the end of the line ,Relevant
A crew of skilled trouble shooters at this stage analyze and repair all problems ,Relevant
When the vehicle passes final audit it is given a price label and driven to a staging lot where it will await shipment to its destination ,Relevant
Once the component parts of the automobile begin to be assembled at the automotive factory production control specialists can follow the progress of each embryonic automobile by means of its Vehicle Identification Number VIN assigned at the start of the production line ,Relevant
In many of the more advanced assembly plants a small radio frequency transponder is attached to the chassis and floor pan ,Irrelevant
This sending unit carries the VIN information and monitors its progress along the assembly process ,Relevant
Knowing what operations the vehicle has been through where it is going and when it should arrive at the next assembly station gives production management personnel the ability to electronically control the manufacturing sequence ,Relevant
Throughout the assembly process quality audit stations keep track of vital information concerning the integrity of various functional components of the vehicle ,Relevant
Here is the life of how an automobile is manufactured ,Irrelevant
Step 1 The metal is delivered to the manufacturing plant and placed on an assembly line ,Relevant
Here it is pressed and ironed by heat to the correct thickness for the needed part ,Relevant
It is then stamped into the correct auto part door fenders roofs and hoods ,Relevant
This process is more precise because of the use of the robotic arms that measure each piece ,Irrelevant
The components are then stockpiled in a central location to be used on the different types of automobiles in the manufacturer s line of automobiles ,Relevant
Step 2 Now comes the welding process ,Irrelevant
Each piece is fitted into place and welded using high heat ,Relevant
This part of the process is handled mostly by robots ,Irrelevant
After each piece is welded into place it is inspected to ensure that it meets all expectations ,Relevant
This is one of the hardest parts of the process because it involves not only the robot being programmed correctly but also depends on the inspector s understanding when a piece just doesn t fit right ,Irrelevant
Step 3 The next part is the one that gives it a clean shiny glow ,Irrelevant
The body of the car gets a nice warm shower to wash away the dirt and grime of the assembly process ,Relevant
Then the car is whisked off to the painting line ,Relevant
It is painted 4 times the primer is first ,Relevant
The car passes through a pool of paint that has electricity running through it ,Relevant
This prevents rusting ,Irrelevant
Stage 2 is the surface where grey paint is sprayed on so that the topcoat will have the same color throughout ,Irrelevant
Top coat is then sprayed onto every surface ,Relevant
The color is chosen by the customer ,Relevant
The last step in this process is the clear coat where the car gets its shiny finish ,Relevant
Step 4 Now the get up and go is added ,Irrelevant
The engine which is made up of forged parts of metal as well as the casted material is assembled into the engine compartment ,Relevant
More than 500 parts of metal are used to make the engine and the suspension ,Irrelevant
We now travel further down the assembly line ,Irrelevant
Step 5 The parts from the suppliers of the nuts and bolts being arriving ,Irrelevant
The suppliers only ship parts for the automobiles that are being produced ,Relevant
This saves space with unneeded parts hanging around ,Irrelevant
Each car manufacturer has their own procedure with procuring the supplies ,Irrelevant
Step 6 Assembly is next where the body moves on a conveyor line and the parts are placed according to a certain set of instructions ,Relevant
If a problem is found the belt stops and the problem is solved ,Relevant
This is an example of man and machine working together ,Irrelevant
Step 7 Inspections are then performed and if the car passes all inspections then it is shipped to the car dealership and then the customer ,Relevant
First the leads are created by mixing graphite powder and clay which is then baked ,Relevant
Next pencil bodies need to be made ,Relevant
If wooden the right material needs to be selected to resist some pressure without breaking and be soft enough to sharpen ,Relevant
Staedtler in Germany use cedarwood from California ,Irrelevant
Precut sections are delivered to the factory ,Relevant
These have grooves cut into them to receive the pencil leads and special glue is added to stick the leads in place ,Relevant
Next every second piece is sent to a separate conveyor ,Relevant
The leads are added to the first and the second wooden slats are glued to the first ones to form a multi pencil sandwich ,Relevant
These are then compressed to let the glue cure ,Relevant
Now the pencil sandwiches are cut lengthways and shaped to form individual unsharpened pencils which later have the points sharpened ,Relevant
The final phase generally involves lacquering the wood to hide the grain adding branding and other markers for identification of the type ,Relevant
The milky latex is actually the tree s sap and incredibly useful it is ,Irrelevant
Firstly molds or formers are cleaned and prepared ,Relevant
To be honest this phase looks a little creepy you ll see what we meanin this video ,Irrelevant
Latex gloves are actually not100% pure ,Irrelevant
Additives are added to improve the elasticity and shelf life of the latex ,Relevant
The cleaned formers or molds are dipped into the latex concoction at a specified time depending on the desired glove thickness ,Relevant
Once coated the formers plus latex covering are heated or vulcanized to prevent cracking whilst drying ,Relevant
Gloves are then leached to remove excess latex to minimize the chance of users having an allergic reaction ,Relevant
After this process the gloves are beaded for ease of donning ,Relevant
The gloves may then be powdered sometimes using cornstarch or chlorinated to reduce their tackiness ,Relevant
Workers then remove the gloves from the formers by hand ready for quality checking packaging and shipping ,Relevant
Obviously the tomato paste is the main ingredient ,Irrelevant
The paste is pumped into a holding tank ready for use ,Relevant
Depending on the batch size measured volumes of paste are passed into a cooking kettle where it is heated and constantly stirred ,Relevant
The other ingredients are then added in a correct proportion to the batch size ,Relevant
The mixture is constantly stirred ,Relevant
Before bottling the ketchup needs to pass through a series of gradual cooling stages ,Relevant
At the same time bottles are prepared and aligned ready for receiving the ketchup ,Relevant
These bottles are then filled with ketchup usually using an automated system caps are added and labels are attached ,Relevant
The bottles of ketchup are now ready for packaging on distribution ,Relevant
Our next example of industrial processes is another interesting one ,Irrelevant
Mineral woolhas a massive variety of applications across many industries ,Irrelevant
The processstarts by taking big chunks of slag and rock melting them down and then spinning the melt into threads of mineral wool ,Relevant
We are sold already ,Irrelevant
The slag and rock tend to be sourced from the steel industry ,Irrelevant
Coke is used to fuel the entire process ,Relevant
The rock and slag are first partially crushed and then loaded into a cupola in alternating layers with coke ,Relevant
As the coke is ignited and burned the mineral is heated to the molten state at a temperature of 1300 to 1650 C 2400 to 3000 F ,Relevant
The molten rock then exits the bottom of the cupola into a fiberizing device which uses one of two processes ,Relevant
The Powell process uses groups of rotors revolving at high speed ,Irrelevant
The molten material is distributed in a thin film on the surfaces of the rotors and then is thrown off by centrifugal force causing long fibrous tails to form ,Relevant
Air or steam is blown around the rotors to assist in fiberizing the material ,Relevant
A second method the Downey process uses a spinning concave rotor and air or steam to help with fiberizing ,Irrelevant
The process is similar to that used when making cotton candy or candy floss for those in the UK ,Irrelevant
Later a binder is added and a large pendulum device is used to deposit the wool in zig zagged sheets the number of layers of which will vary depending on final requirements ,Relevant
This loosely packed mat is then passed through rollers to compress it and form more uniform sheets ,Relevant
Additional heat is usually applied to cure the binder ,Relevant
The sheets then pass through more rollers to compress it further which are then trimmed and cut to form the final product ,Relevant
Pretty neat and very cool to watch ,Irrelevant
Molten polycarbonate plastic is used to make the actual disk ,Irrelevant
Digital information if used is then stamped onto it while the disk is still near the melting point ,Relevant
Often this involves a die and the stamp creates microscopic bumps called pits and lands ,Relevant
These provide the binary coding for the data to be read ,Irrelevant
Once complete the reflective foil layer is applied using a process called sputtering or wet silvering ,Relevant
This allows the reader s laser to reflect the light back to the player ,Relevant
This is usually made of aluminum but can also include precious metals such as silver gold or platinum ,Irrelevant
To finish a lacquer coating is applied to seal the reflective layer and prevent oxidation ,Relevant
Ice cream sandwichesare very satisfying to eat and also to watch being made ,Irrelevant
Honestly you won t be disappointed ,Irrelevant
The process is pretty simple but the engineering behind the machines less so ,Irrelevant
Ice cream is first whipped to add air ,Relevant
This is fed into the next part of the assembly ,Relevant
Here two sets of wafers are sandwiched together as the ice cream is simultaneously injected between them ,Relevant
They are then packaged refrigerated obviously and shipped out for you all to enjoy ,Relevant
Giant specialized mixers are used to mix these ingredients under high temperatures and pressures ,Relevant
Recipes will vary slightly from each part of the tire but the final result at this stage is thin rubber gum ,Irrelevant
These are rolled into sheets ,Relevant
Then the task of assembling the tire on a tire building machine begins ,Relevant
Differentcombinations of cloth metal and rubber from each component of the tire skeleton walls and treads etc are combined together to form the final product ,Relevant
The last step is to cure the tire ,Relevant
The green tire is heated at more than 300 degrees Fahrenheit for twelve to fifteen minutes vulcanizing it to bond the components and to cure the rubber ,Relevant
Dart manufactureis a proper example of some old school industrial processes ,Irrelevant
The flight shafts are made first ,Relevant
3 meteraluminum rods are loaded into a machine that has several cutting tools ,Relevant
These tools work from many angles simultaneously on each rod ,Irrelevant
The rod is made into several shafts with threads cut so they can be attached to the final dart barrel ,Irrelevant
A cross saw cuts the slot for the arrow flights on the other end ,Relevant
The entire process is carried out with a liberal amount of oil to carry away the metal shavings and keep the cutting tools cool ,Relevant
Brass rods are loaded into a similar machine to make the dart barrels ,Relevant
These are then tooled and fashioned into the barrels the bit you hold ,Relevant
One end is threaded and tapered so the shaft can be attached as well as to make the arrow aerodynamic ,Relevant
Grooves are also cut into the barrels surface to make the arrow easy and comfortable to hold ,Relevant
Barrels can also be made of tungsten these allow for narrower parts to be created ,Relevant
Professional players actually prefer tungsten darts FYI ,Irrelevant
The final step is to create a dart point ,Relevant
This is achieved by forcing pointed steel into the hollow part of the barrel using a hydraulic press ,Relevant
Dart segments are then assembled and the flights attached to create one perfectly crafted dart ,Relevant
The process behind making potato chips crisps if you re British is also pretty interesting ,Irrelevant
To start off with having a batch of potatoes is obviously handy ,Relevant
These are delivered to the factory in large quantities ,Relevant
Each and everyone is checked for quality and taste ,Relevant
Some are punched with holes to allow tracking through the cooking process ,Relevant
Defective potatoes are kept to one side for instance if they have green edges or blemishes ,Relevant
If their weight exceeds the factory s preset allowances the entire shipment can be sent back to the supplier ,Relevant
Acceptable potatoes are then fed via conveyor belts into a vertical helical conveyor ,Relevant
This removes dirt and stones if any and the potatoes are then passed on to an automatic peeler ,Relevant
The peeled potatoes are then passed through a revolving impaler presser that cuts them into uniform paper thin slices ,Relevant
The blades can be either straight or ridged depending on the product ,Relevant
Excess starch can be removed in a cold soak ,Relevant
Color treatment is also added at this stage if required ,Relevant
The paper thin potato slices now pass on to the important bit frying and salting ,Relevant
They first pass under air jets to remove excess water ,Relevant
The slices are then passed through very hot oil between 176 and 190 degrees centigrade ,Relevant
They are gently passed along with paddles ,Relevant
As they complete their trip through the oil salt is added at a predetermined concentration ,Relevant
Flavoring is also added if needed ,Relevant
Potato chips are then drained of excess oil cooled and sorted and burned ones are removed automatically using optical sorters before packaging ,Relevant
The process starts by melting recycled glass as well as previously rejected marble stocks e g marbles that were too big or too small ,Relevant
All of these random assortments of glass are fed into a kiln for melting ,Relevant
16 hours lateror so the molten glass is drained from the kiln and is ready for processing ,Relevant
A cutter bar cuts the stream of molten glass every half a second to make little pieces of glass called slugs ,Relevant
These will eventually become marbles ,Irrelevant
Marble sizes are determined by altering the time intervals of the shearing action quicker for smaller marbles slower for large ones ,Irrelevant
The still hot slugs then pass through a series of constantly rotating metal ridged rollers that keep the slugs separated while cooling them and giving them their signature spherical shape ,Relevant
The marble s final appearance or coloring was determined in the kiln as air passed coloring through the molten glass ,Irrelevant
Solidified marbles are then sorted by size ,Relevant
Firstly the metal jacket for the bullet is formed from stretching copper cups to receive the lead core at a later stage ,Relevant
Hornady prefers to use mechanical force to achieve this rather than heating and molding ,Irrelevant
This takes several stages to gradually stretch the copper to its desired length and diameter ,Irrelevant
A lead core is later added inside the jacket ,Relevant
Further stages of mechanical force are used to slowly form the characteristic bullet shape ,Relevant
This reshaping leads to excess lead being forced out of the top of the bullet ,Relevant
These are trimmed off ,Relevant
Further forced reshaping occurs and once again excess lead is trimmed off the nose until the complete finalized bullet shape is achieved ,Relevant
Excess lead is shaped to form the bullet tip ,Relevant
Acme Corp operational division identifies a staffing need and notifies Human Resources input ,Relevant
Human Resources provides the operational division with a data sheet soliciting a detailed job description and a list of key skill sets needed by potential applicants ,Relevant
Human Resources receives completed data sheet and acquires approval through executive staff to solicit for candidates to fill the staffing need ,Relevant
Human Resources posts the solicitation on existing job boards and Acme Corp web site with detailed job description skill sets and application deadline date ,Relevant
Upon application deadline date Human Resources compiles list of applications and forwards to operational division for screening ,Relevant
Operational division screens qualified applicants and provides Human Resources with names of applicants for initial interviews ,Relevant
Human Resources schedules interviews with candidates and operational division ,Relevant
Upon completion of initial interviews operational division notifies Human Resources of names of candidates for second interviews ,Relevant
Human Resources Division schedules second interview with candidates and operational division ,Relevant
Following second interviews the operational division notifies Human Resources of its selection ,Relevant
Human Resources notifies the selected candidate and sends the candidate an offer letter ,Relevant
Human Resources receives the candidate s signed offer letter ,Relevant
Human Resources initiates the creation of a new personnel folder for the candidate and schedules a start date output ,Relevant
Personnel Staffing Process ends and new employee is handed off to New Employee Onboarding Process ,Relevant
The following description of the manufacturing process is for driver side air bag module assembly ,Irrelevant
Passenger side air bag module assemblies are produced slightly differently ,Irrelevant
The propellant consists of sodium azide mixed together with an oxidizer a substance that helps the sodium azide to burn when ignited ,Irrelevant
The sodium azide is received from outside vendors and inspected to make sure it conforms to requirements ,Relevant
After inspection it is placed in a safe storage place until needed ,Relevant
At the same time the oxidizer is received from outside vendors inspected and stored ,Relevant
Different manufacturers use different oxidizers ,Irrelevant
From storage the sodium azide and the oxidizer are then carefully blended under sophisticated computerized process control ,Relevant
Because of the possibility of explosions the powder processing takes place in isolated bunkers ,Relevant
If the event safety sensors detect a spark high speed deluge systems will douse whole rooms with water ,Relevant
Production occurs in several redundant smaller facilities so that if an accident does occur production will not be shut down only decreased ,Irrelevant
After blending the propellant mixture is sent to storage ,Relevant
Presses are then used to compress the propellant mixture into disk or pellet form ,Relevant
The inflator components such as the metal canister the filter assemblystainless steel wire mesh with ceramic material insideand initiator or igniter are received from outside vendors and inspected ,Relevant
The components are then assembled on a highly automated production line ,Relevant
The inflator sub assembly is combined with the propellant and an initiator to form the inflator assembly ,Relevant
Laser welding using CO 2 gas is used to join stainless steel inflator sub assemblies while friction inertial welding is used to join aluminum inflator sub assemblies ,Relevant
Laser welding entails using laser beams to weld the assemblies together while friction inertial welding involves rubbing two metals together until the surfaces become hot enough to join together ,Relevant
The inflator assembly is then tested and sent to storage until needed ,Relevant
The woven nylon air bag fabric is received from outside vendors and inspected for any material defects ,Relevant
The air bag fabric is then die cut to the proper shapes and sewn internally and externally to properly join the two sides ,Relevant
After the air bag is sewn it is inflated and checked for any seam imperfections ,Relevant
The air bag assembly is then mounted to the tested inflator assembly ,Relevant
Next the air bag is folded and the breakaway plastic horn pad cover is installed ,Relevant
Finally the completed module assembly is inspected and tested ,Relevant
The module assemblies are packaged in boxes for shipment and then sent to customers ,Relevant
The remaining components of the air bag systemthe crash sensors the diagnostic monitoring unit the steering wheel connecting coil and the indicator lampare combined with the air bag module during vehicle assembly ,Relevant
All the components are connected and communicate through a wiring harness ,Relevant
Early in the process sometimes even before the leather is cut the letteringusually foil tapeidentifying the manufacturer is burned into the leather with a brass stamping die ,Relevant
The shell of the glove is sewn together while inside out ,Relevant
It is then turned right side out and its lining is inserted ,Relevant
Before being reversed the shell is mulled wetted orsteamed for flexibility so that it doesn t crack or rip when it is turned ,Relevant
The turned shell is put on a device known as a hot hand which is a hand shaped metallic form its heat helps the shell form to its correct size ,Relevant
At this point the hot hand also assures that all the openings for the fingers finger stalls are open correctly ,Relevant
A pad is inserted into the heel of a glove ,Relevant
Better gloves have two part pads that make it easier for the glove to flex in the correct direction when squeezed ,Irrelevant
The padding in a glove is made of two layers of leather hand stitched together ,Irrelevant
Catchers mitts which need a thicker palm than other gloves are made with five layers of leather padding ,Irrelevant
At this same point plastic reinforcements are inserted at the thumb and toe little finger sections of the glove ,Relevant
These devices provide added support for the glove and protect the player s fingers from being bent backwards accidentally ,Irrelevant
Before all the parts of the glove are laced together the web is fabricated out of several pieces of leather ,Relevant
The web can consist of anywhere from two to six pieces of leather depending on the type of web desired ,Irrelevant
The lacing around the edges of a glove is usually one piece of rawhide that might be as much as 80 90 inches 203 228 centimeters long ,Irrelevant
The lacing begins at the thumb or little finger and holds the entire glove together ,Irrelevant
The final lacing operation is at the web section ,Relevant
Some non leather stitching is needed for the individual partsthe web for instance is usually stitched together with nylon thread ,Relevant
The strap across the back of the hand of a glove used to be lined with shearling sheepskin a synthetic material is now used ,Relevant
Catchers mitts and first base gloves 1Oare hand assembled and sewn from four partspalm pad back and web ,Relevant
The palm and back are sewn together first and then joined together with the other pieces with rawhide lacing ,Relevant
The final step is called a lay off operation the glove is again placed on a hot hand to adjust any shaping problems and to make sure that the openings for the fingers finger stalls have remained open throughout the manufacturing process ,Relevant
In an alkaline battery the cathode actually doubles as part of the container ,Irrelevant
Huge loads of the constituent ingredientsmanganese dioxide carbon black graphite and an electrolyte potassium hydroxide in solution aredelivered by train and mixed in very large batches at the production site ,Relevant
The mixture is then granulated and pressed or compacted into hollow cylinders calledpreforms ,Relevant
Depending on the size of the battery being made several preforms may be stacked one on top of another in a battery ,Irrelevant
Alternatively the series of preforms can be replaced by an extruded ring of the same material ,Irrelevant
The preforms are next inserted into a nickel plated steel can the combination of the preforms and the steel can make up the cathode of the battery ,Relevant
In a large operation the cans are made at the battery factory using standard cutting and forming techniques ,Irrelevant
An indentation is made near the top of the can and an asphalt or epoxy sealant is placed above the indentation to protect against leakage ,Relevant
A paper separator soaked in the electrolyte solution is then inserted inside the can against the preforms the separator is made from several pieces of paper laid at crossgrains to each other like plywood ,Relevant
Looking down at an open can one would see what looks like a paper cup inserted into the can ,Irrelevant
The separator keeps the cathode material from coming into contact with the anode material ,Irrelevant
As an alternative a manufacturer might use a porous synthetic fiber for the same purpose ,Irrelevant
The anode goes into the battery can next ,Relevant
It is a gel composed primarily of zinc powder along with other materials including a potassium hydroxide electrolyte ,Irrelevant
This gel has the consistency of a very thick paste ,Irrelevant
Rather than a solution it is chemically a suspension in which particles do not settle though an appropriate filter could separate them ,Irrelevant
The gel does not fill the can to the top so as to allow space for the chemical reactions that will occur once the battery is put into use ,Irrelevant
Though the battery is able to produce electricity at this point an open cell is not practical and would exhaust its potential rapidly ,Irrelevant
The battery needs to be sealed with three connected components ,Relevant
The first a brass nail or long spike is inserted into the middle of the can through the gel material and serves as a current collector ,Relevant
The second is a plastic seal and the third a metal end cap ,Relevant
The nail which extends about two thirdsof the way into the can is welded to the metal end cap and then passed through the plastic seal ,Relevant
This seal is significantly thinner in some places than in others so that if too much gas builds up in the can the seal will rupture rather than the entire battery ,Irrelevant
Some battery designs make use of a wax filled hole in the plastic excess gas pushes through the wax rather than rupturing the battery ,Irrelevant
The seal assembly meets the indentation made in the can at the beginning of the process and is crimped in place ,Relevant
The opposite end of the can the positive end of the battery is then closed with a steel plate that is either welded in place or glued with an epoxy type cement ,Relevant
Before the battery leaves the factory a label is added identifying the type of battery its size and other information ,Relevant
The label is often paper that is simply glued to the battery ,Irrelevant
One large manufacturer has its label design printed on plastic shrink wrap a loose fitting piece of heat sensitive plastic is wrapped around the battery can and then exposed to a blast of heat that makes the plastic shrink down to fit tightly around the can ,Irrelevant
Although more clothing manufacturers are making and distributing bicycle shorts for general sport and even nonathletic use this section will describe how the short designed for the professional cyclist is manufactured ,Irrelevant
First the fabric usually a blend of polyester cotton spandex and nylon must be manufactured ,Relevant
This involves spinning and combining the various threads into a single fabric washing and drying the fabric and then dyeing it ,Relevant
Next it is saturated or sprayed with a water resistant finish before being cut into panels according to pattern specifications set by the designer ,Relevant
The various panels are then carefully sewn together ,Relevant
To avoid raised ridges seams may be offset for a smoother finish ,Relevant
Finally elastic is inserted in the waistband of the sewn short ,Relevant
Gripper elastic bands are also sewn into the cuffs at the short s hem ,Relevant
The chamois liner s layers are cut out according to pattern specifications before being bonded or laminated together ,Relevant
After assembly they are stitched along the outer edges to prevent fraying ,Relevant
Sometimes a special thread similar to a soft floss is used to prevent chafing ,Relevant
The finished product will have a molded look ,Irrelevant
It is usually inserted inside the bicycle short with a strip of tape to hold it in place ,Relevant
Several manufacturers have developed a one piece chamois that does not require any seams and avoids any overlapping of material ,Irrelevant
The completed bicycle short is tested for defects ,Relevant
After passing inspection it is ready to be packaged and shipped to a retailer ,Relevant
The bulb can be made using various processes but it is most commonly produced using vacuum assisted injection molding ,Irrelevant
Compressed air is used to blow the melted rubber or neoprene material into the cavity of a two piece metal die set featuring the negative image of the bulb the operation resembles blowing a gum bubble inside a bottle ,Relevant
The die also contains small holes through which air is drawn out just before the material is injected helping it flow into the die cavity at a uniform thickness ,Relevant
While these holes are large enough to allow air to escape they are too small to permit significant amounts of the rubber to seep out ,Irrelevant
The remnant of the rubber material that is drawn into the holes produces small protuberances that resemble the small whiskers visible on a new tire ,Relevant
Within a few seconds of its injection the material has cooled so that the die may be opened revealing the finished bulb ,Relevant
After a minimal amount of hand work to remove the whiskers the bulb is ready to be attached to the other components ,Relevant
The valves are made by die casting plastic injection molding and machining from bar material ,Irrelevant
They incorporate connection features that allow the bulb and hose to be attached ,Relevant
Machined valves can be made on a lathe controlled by a computer program that instructs it to turn the shape threads and other features ,Irrelevant
The gauge consists of further sub assemblies each of which contains machined molded and stamped parts ,Relevant
The most important component of the gauge is the pressure element ,Irrelevant
It is constructed by soldering two disks together at the formed lip to construct a hollow wafer ,Irrelevant
The pressure from the system is introduced into the wafer though a hole in the socket connection which in turn is connected to the squeeze bulb and cuff ,Relevant
As the internal pressure increases the wafer swells ,Irrelevant
It is this swelling that is detected by the movement assembly causing the pointer to rotate about the dial ,Irrelevant
After assembly the gauge must be calibrated ,Relevant
This is accomplished by connecting it to a pressure source with a master gauge of known accuracy ,Relevant
Slight adjustments are made in the movement linkage until the pointer of the gauge reflects the correct pressure readings ,Relevant
The constricting cuff or bladder is made by heat sealing two rubber sheets together to form a flexible band ,Relevant
A tubing fitting is incorporated into this sealing process providing a connection for the air supply ,Relevant
A fabric covering is then sewn to the bladder by conventional methods ,Relevant
The hoses are made by continuous extrusion a process in which pellets of rubber or similar material are heated to the melting point at which they become clay like and viscous ,Relevant
Within the same machine a rotating screw device forces this molten material through a die block which is simply a hole in an aluminum block the same size as the outside of the tubing ,Relevant
Secured within the block is a rod that is the same size as the inside of the tubing and positioned in the center of the hole ,Irrelevant
As the material flows around the rod and out the hole it cools and assumes the shape of the tubing ,Relevant
At this point it is cut to length and coiled onto spools for shipment to the assembly facility ,Relevant
At final assembly hoses are used to connect the components discussed above ,Relevant
The hoses are then checked for leaks and the calibration is verified ,Relevant
This is a good example of JITjust in time material requirements planning and TQCtotal quality concept management ,Irrelevant
Missing any one of the components the entire assembly is useless ,Irrelevant
The plant must receive the parts and supplies in a timely manner to assure delivery of the finished product to the customer ,Irrelevant
The items must be of satisfactory quality so they can be assembled correctly and without compromising the design ,Irrelevant
Many companies today have established quality management procedures ,Irrelevant
These procedures are simply intensive studies of all aspects of manufacture to eliminate or reduce the possibility of producing a defective part ,Irrelevant
Denim unlike many types of cloth which are woven in one place and sent to another for dying is woven and dyed at one location ,Irrelevant
There are several steps between ginned cotton cotton after it has been picked from fields and processed and cotton yarn ,Irrelevant
The incoming cotton is removed from tightly packed bales and inspected before undergoing a process known ascarding ,Relevant
In this process the cotton is put through machines that contain brushes with bent wire teeth ,Relevant
These brushescalledcardsclean disentangle straighten and gather together thecotton fibers ,Relevant
At this point the fibers are calledslivers ,Irrelevant
Other machines join several slivers together and these slivers are then pulled and twisted which serves to make the threads stronger ,Relevant
Next these ropes are put on spinning machines that further twist and stretch the fibers to form yarn ,Relevant
Some cloths are woven see step 5 below and then dyed but denim is usually dyed with chemically synthesized indigo before being woven ,Relevant
Large balls of yarn called ball warps are dipped in the indigo mixture several times so that the dye covers the yarn in layers ,Relevant
These many layers of indigo dye explain why blue jeans fade slightly with each washing ,Irrelevant
Although the exact chemicals used in such dyeing procedures remain trade secrets it is known that a small amount of sulfur is often used to stabilize the top or bottom layers of indigo dye ,Relevant
The dyed yarn is thenslashed that is it is coated with sizing any one of a variety of starchy substances to make the threads stronger and stiffer ,Relevant
Once this operation is complete the yarn threads are ready to woven with undyed filling yarn threads ,Relevant
The yarn is then woven on large mechanical looms ,Relevant
Denim is not 100 percent blue as the blue dyed threads forming thewarplong vertical threads are combined with white threads forming theweftshorter horizontalthreads ,Relevant
Because denim is woven with the blue threads packed closer together than the white threads and with the blue threads covering three out of four white threads the blue threads dominate ,Irrelevant
By examining a piece of denim closely one can detect the steep diagonal pattern that results from this process which is known as a three by one right hand twill weave ,Irrelevant
Although mechanized looms make use of the same basic weaving procedure as a simple hand loom they are much larger and faster ,Irrelevant
A modern shuttle less loom which uses a very small carrier instead of the traditional shuttle to weave the weft threads between the warp threads may produce as much as 3 279 yards 3 000 meters of cloth 3 28 or 4 37 yards three or four meters wide in a single week ,Irrelevant
As much as 1 093 yards 1 000 meters of cloth may be rolled into a single huge bolt ,Irrelevant
At this point the denim is ready for finishing a term referring to a variety of treatments applied to cloth after it is woven ,Relevant
With denim finishing is usually fairly simple ,Irrelevant
The cloth is brushed to remove loose threads and lint and the denim is usually skewed in a way that will prevent it from twisting when it is made into clothing ,Relevant
The denim may then besanforized or preshrunk ,Relevant
Preshrunk denim should shrink no more than three percent after three washings ,Irrelevant
Once the desired design is selected patterns from the design are cut from heavy paper or cardboard ,Relevant
Up to 80 different sizes are possible from one pattern ,Irrelevant
The pieces of denim are then cut with high speed cutting machines from stacks 100 layers thick ,Relevant
Excluding rivets buttons and zippers a pair of blue jeans contains about ten different pieces from the pockets to the leg panels to the waistband and belt loops ,Irrelevant
The pieces of denim are ready to be sewn at this point ,Relevant
Sewing is done in an assembly line fashion with rows of industrial human operated sewing machines ,Relevant
Each sewer is assigned a specific function such as making only back pockets ,Irrelevant
First the various pockets and belt loops are assembled ,Relevant
Next one sewer attaches the pockets to the leg seams another then sews the leg seams together and still another attaches the waist band ,Relevant
Once the waist band is secure the belt loops may be stitched on and the buttons attached ,Relevant
If the jeans include a zipper it is then sewn into place and the pants are hemmed ,Relevant
Finally the rivets are placed in the appropriate places and the maker s label is sewn on last ,Relevant
Some jeans are prewashed and or stone washed to alter the appearance or texture of the finished jeans ,Relevant
Prewashing involves washing the jeans in industrial detergent for a short time to soften the denim ,Irrelevant
Stone washing also means washing the jeans but pumice is added to the load resulting in a faded appearance ,Irrelevant
Small stones less than one inch [one centimeter] in diameter produce an even abrasion while large stones about four inches [10 centimeters] in diameter highlight the seams and pockets and produce a more uneven appearance ,Irrelevant
The completed pair of blue jeans is I0then pressed ,Relevant
They are placed into a large pressing machine that steam irons the entire garment at once in about a minute ,Relevant
A size tag is punched into the material and the jeans are folded stacked and placed in boxes according to style color and size before being sent to the warehouse for storage ,Relevant
When the jeans are selected to be sent to a store they are put in large shipping cartons and sent on freight trains or trucks ,Relevant
After the book is written and appropriate design elements are agreed upon book production can begin ,Relevant
The first stage istype setting in which the actual text is converted into the appropriate typeface style known asfont and size known aspoint size ,Relevant
After the typeset version of the book has been reviewed and any necessary changes made it is ready for printing and binding in which the actual pages are printed and bound together with the cover resulting in a finished book ,Relevant
The typesetting and printing printing consists of filming and all subsequent stepsare typically done not by the publisher but by specialized vendors ,Relevant
First the manuscript is converted into the desired font and point size ,Relevant
If the manuscript has not been completed on a computer it must be typed into a computer by the type setter ,Relevant
If it is already in electronic form however the typesetter simply has to make programming changes to convert the manuscript into the proper style ,Relevant
The result is generally but not always see step #3 below agalleyof the text ,Irrelevant
A galley form of manuscript consists of long pages of text in a single column ,Irrelevant
The galley includes the proper typeface but the proper pagination still must be worked out ,Irrelevant
Galleys are then proofread and edited for errors by the publisher ,Relevant
This stage is particularly important if the manuscript has been typeset typed from a hard copy of the text ,Irrelevant
If the manuscript was typeset from a computer disk most of the errors should have already been corrected during a review of the manuscript ,Irrelevant
The single column format of galleys facilitates the proofreading ,Irrelevant
After galleys are thoroughly proofed and edited pages or lasers are produced ,Relevant
An exact layout of typeset pages but usually printed on standard typing paper pages are also reviewed for accuracy by the publisher ,Relevant
Some books skip the galley stage and proceed directly to pages ,Relevant
Once any necessary changes have been made the typesetter then produces a mechanical of the typeset pages ,Relevant
Also called camera copy the mechanical is printed on high quality paper that is suitable for filming the first stage in the printing process ,Irrelevant
The work of the typesetting vendorif different from the publisheris now done ,Irrelevant
The typeset mechanical now goes to the printing and binding vendor ,Relevant
First each text page including line drawings is photographed or shot using a large camera to produce page negatives ,Relevant
These negatives are the opposite of what will actually print ,Irrelevant
In other words the text and photos will appear backward in negative form ,Irrelevant
Negatives are then checked to make sure there are no blemishes present ,Relevant
While printed words and line drawings are all one shade of black photographs have many shades from palest gray to deepest black and must be filmed using a special process to maintain these shades ,Irrelevant
The process converts the shades into black and white dotsvery light areas have many dots while darker areas have fewer dots ,Relevant
The converted photographs are known ashalftones ,Irrelevant
If the book will have more than one color of ink a separate negative for each color is made ,Relevant
For color photos for instance four negatives are generally used cyan magenta yellow and black ,Irrelevant
For this reason books with color will have negative overlays one negative overlay for each color ,Irrelevant
Because of the added overlays a book printed in more than one color involves additional preparation and cost ,Irrelevant
The negatives are then taped or stripped into their proper place onto a large sheet called agoldenrodora flat ,Relevant
Each flat holds 32 or 64 pages and enough flats are used to equal the number of pages in the book ,Irrelevant
Strippers examine each finished flat on a lineup table to ensure that text and illustrations are properly lined up and in sequence ,Relevant
The book pages are not lined up in consecutive order on the flat and in fact some of the pages are placed upside down ,Relevant
Such placing is necessary because the finished paper version of each flat will be folded several times once the flat is folded the 32 or 64 pages will be in the proper order ,Irrelevant
This placement method is known asimposition ,Irrelevant
To make this examination process easier the lineup tables are equipped with a fluorescent light that shines up through the negatives so it is easier for the stripper to read and align the text ,Irrelevant
To make sure the book is progressing properly a proof of each flat is made by shining ultraviolet light through the negatives to expose their images onto a special light sensitive paper ,Relevant
The resulting pages are calledblueprintsor silverprints bluelines or dyluxes because the paper and ink are blue or silver in appearance ,Irrelevant
The blueprints are then checked carefully by the publisher ,Relevant
If an editor or art director finds an error on a blueprint or decides to make a change the page in question has to be rephotographed ,Relevant
The new negative will then be stripped onto the flat ,Relevant
7 After final approval each flat is photographed with the negatives being exposed onto or burned onto a thin sheet of aluminum called aplate ,Relevant
The sections of the plates that contain text and illustrations are then treated with a chemical that attracts ink thereby ensuring that the text and illustrations will print when on press ,Relevant
The plates are then sent to press ,Relevant
If printing in only one color each plate will require only one pass through the press ,Relevant
If printing more than one color an additional pass will be required for each color ,Relevant
For example if two colors are used the paper is fed through the press twice ,Irrelevant
There are three main printing processes used in book production offset lithography letter press andgravure ,Irrelevant
The process used depends less on quality differences than on economic factors such as availability ofmachines number of books being printed the print run and the speed of delivery ,Irrelevant
Presses are eithersheet fedsingle sheets of paper are fed through orweb fedhuge rolls of paper are unwound and run through ,Relevant
After the sheets are printed and dry they are delivered to the bindery ,Relevant
While many large printing companies have their own binderies other smaller printers must send the printed sheets to a outside bindery ,Irrelevant
At the bindery the flats are folded and collated into booksignaturesproperly folded 32 or 64 page sectionsthat are then bound in proper sequence ,Relevant
All of these functions are automated ,Irrelevant
Book binding also involves sewing the signatures together gluing the spine and inserting lining and trimming the edges ,Relevant
The amount and type of binding depends on the type of book paperback or hardback and its size ,Irrelevant
In the final step the book is cased in or enclosed in a cover ,Relevant
The initial step in producing brick is crushing and grinding the raw materials in a separator and a jaw crusher ,Relevant
Next the blend of ingredients desired for each particular batch is selected and filtered before being sent on to one of three brick shaping processesextrusion molding or pressing the first of which is the most adaptable and thus the most common ,Relevant
Once the bricks are formed and any subsequent procedures performed they are dried to remove excess moisture that might otherwise cause cracking during the ensuing firing process ,Relevant
Next they are fired in ovens and then cooled ,Relevant
Finally they are dehackedautomatically stacked wrapped with steel bands and padded with plastic corner protectors ,Relevant
First each of the ingredients is conveyed to a separator that removes oversize material ,Relevant
A jaw crusher with horizontal steel plates then squeezes the particles rendering them still smaller ,Relevant
After the raw materials for each batch of bricks have been selected a scalping screen is often used to separate the different sizes of material ,Relevant
Material of the correct size is sent to storage silos and over sized material goes to a hammermill which pulverizes it with rapidly moving steel hammers ,Relevant
The hammermill uses another screen to control the maximum size of particle leaving the mill and discharge goes to a number of vibrating screens that separate out material of improper size before it is sent on to the next phase of production ,Relevant
With extrusion the most common method of brick forming pulverized material and water are fed into one end of apug mill which uses knives on a rotating shaft to cut through and fold together material in a shallow chamber ,Relevant
The blend is then fed into an extruder at the far end of the mill ,Relevant
The extruder usually consists of two chambers ,Irrelevant
The first removes air from the ground clay with a vacuum thereby preventing cracking and other defects ,Relevant
The second chamber a high pressure cylinder compacts the material so the auger can extrude it through the die ,Relevant
After it is compressed the plastic material is forced out of the chamber though a specially shaped die orifice ,Relevant
The cross section of the extruded column called the pug is formed into the shape of the die ,Relevant
Sections of desired length are cut to size with rotating knives or stiff wires ,Relevant
In molding soft wet clay is shaped in a mold usually a wooden box ,Relevant
The interior of the box is often coated with sand which provides the desired texture and facilitates removing the formed brick from the mold ,Relevant
Water can also be used to assist release ,Relevant
Pressing the third type of brick forming requires a material with low water content ,Irrelevant
The material is placed in a die and then compacted with a steel plunger set at a desired pressure ,Relevant
More regular in shape and sharper in outline than brick made with the other two methods pressed bricks also feature frogs ,Irrelevant
Chamfering machines were developed to produce a furrow in brick for such applications as paving ,Irrelevant
These machines use rollers to indent the brick as it is being extruded ,Irrelevant
They are sometimes equipped with wire cutters to do the chamfering and cutting in one step ,Irrelevant
Such machines can produce as many as 20 000 units per hour ,Irrelevant
The choice of sand coating also applied as the brick is extruded depends on how soft or hard the extruded material is ,Irrelevant
A continuous vibrating feeder is used to coat soft material whereas for textured material the coating may have to be brushed or rolled on ,Relevant
For harder materials a pressure roller or compressed air is used and for extremely hard materials sand blasting is required ,Relevant
Before the brick is fired it must be dried to remove excess moisture ,Relevant
If this moisture is not removed the water will burn off too quickly during firing causing cracking ,Relevant
Two types of dryers are used ,Irrelevant
Tunnel dryers use cars to move the brick through humidity controlled zones that prevent cracking ,Irrelevant
They consist of a long chamber through which the ware is slowly pushed ,Irrelevant
External sources of fan circulated hot air are forced into the dryer to speed the process ,Relevant
Automatic chamber dryers are also used especially in Europe ,Irrelevant
The extruded bricks are automatically placed in rows on two parallel bars ,Relevant
The bricks are then fed onto special racks with finger like devices that hold several pairs of bars in multiple layers ,Relevant
These racks are then transferred by rail mounted transfer cars or by lift trucks into the dryers ,Relevant
After drying the brick is loaded onto cars usually automatically and fired tohigh temperatures in furnaces called kilns ,Relevant
In general the cars that moved the bricks through the drying process are also used to convey them through the tunnel kiln ,Relevant
These cars are pushed through the kiln s continuously maintained temperature zones at a specific rate that depends on the material ,Irrelevant
The majority of kilns in the United States use gas as a fuel source though a third of the brick currently produced is fired using solid fuels such as sawdust and coal ,Irrelevant
Tunnel kilns have changed in design from high load narrow width kilns to shorter lower set wider kilns that can fire more brick ,Irrelevant
This type of design has also led to high velocity long flame and low temperature flame burners which have improved temperature uniformity and lowered fuel consumption ,Irrelevant
After the brick is fired and cooled it is unloaded from the kiln car via the dehacking process which has been automated to the point where almost all manual brickhandling is eliminated ,Relevant
Automated setting machines have been developed that can set brick at rates of over 18 000 per hour and can rotate the brick 180 degrees ,Irrelevant
Usually set in rows eleven bricks wide a stack is wrapped with steel bands and fitted with plastic strips that serve as corner protectors ,Relevant
The packaged brick is then shipped to the job site where it is typically unloaded using boom trucks ,Relevant
Some bulletproof vests are custom made to meet the customer s protection needs or size ,Irrelevant
Most however meet standard protection regulations have standard clothing industry sizes such as 38 long 32 short and are sold in quantity ,Irrelevant
To make Kevlar the polymer poly para phenylene terephthalamide must first be produced in the laboratory ,Relevant
This is done through a process known aspolymerization which involves combining molecules into long chains ,Irrelevant
The resultant crystalline liquid with polymers in the shape of rods is then extruded through a spinneret a small metal plate full of tiny holes that looks like a shower head to form Kevlar yarn ,Relevant
The Kevlar fiber then passes through a cooling bath to help it harden ,Relevant
After being sprayed with water the synthetic fiber is wound onto rolls ,Relevant
The Kevlar manufacturer then typically sends the fiber to throwsters who twist the yarn to make it suitable for weaving ,Relevant
To make Kevlar cloth the yarns are woven in the simplest pattern plain or tabby weave which is merely the over and under pattern of threads that interlace alternatively ,Relevant
Unlike Kevlar the Spectra used in bulletproof vests is usually not woven ,Irrelevant
Instead the strong polyethylene polymer filaments are spun into fibers that are then laid parallel to each other ,Relevant
Resin is used to coat the fibers sealing them together to form a sheet of Spectra cloth ,Relevant
Two sheets of this cloth are then placed at right angles to one another and again bonded forming a nonwoven fabric that is next sandwiched between two sheets of polyethylene film ,Relevant
The vest shape can then be cut from the material ,Relevant
Kevlar cloth is sent in large rolls to the bulletproof vest manufacturer ,Relevant
The fabric is first unrolled onto a cutting table that must be long enough to allow several panels to be cut out at a time sometimes it can be aslong as 32 79 yards 30 meters ,Relevant
As many layers of the material as needed as few as eight layers or as many as 25 depending on the level of protection desired are laid out on the cutting table ,Relevant
A cut sheet similar to pattern pieces used for home sewing is then placed on the layers of cloth ,Relevant
For maximum use of the material some manufacturers use computer graphics systems to determine the optimal placement of the cut sheets ,Irrelevant
Using a hand held machine that performs like a jigsaw except that instead of a cutting wire it has a 5 91 inch 15 centimeter cutting wheel similar to that on the end of a pizza cutter a worker cuts around the cut sheets to form panels which are then placed in precise stacks ,Relevant
While Spectra Shield generally does not require sewing as its panels are usually just cut and stacked in layers that go into tight fitting pouches in the vest a bulletproof vest made from Kevlar can be either quilt stitched or box stitched ,Irrelevant
Quilt stitching forms small diamonds of cloth separated by stitching whereas box stitching forms a large single box in the middle of the vest ,Relevant
Quilt stitching is more labor intensive and difficult and it provides a stiff panel that is hard to shift away from vulnerable areas ,Irrelevant
Box stitching on the other hand is fast and easy and allows the free movement of the vest ,Irrelevant
To sew the layers together workers place a stencil on top of the layers and rub chalk on the exposed areas of the panel making a dotted line on the cloth ,Relevant
A sewer then stitches the layers together following the pattern made by the chalk ,Relevant
Next a size label is sewn onto the panel ,Relevant
The shells for the panels are sewn together in the same factory using standard industrial sewing machines and standard sewing practices ,Relevant
The panels are then slipped inside the shells and the accessoriessuch as the strapsare sewn on ,Relevant
The finished bulletproof vest is boxed and shipped to the customer ,Relevant
The manufacturing of candles consists of three steps preparation of the wicking preparation of the wax base and continuous molding or extrusion of the finished candles ,Irrelevant
The cotton or linen wicks are braided and then treated with chemicals or inorganic salt solutions so that they bend at a 90 degree angle when burning ,Relevant
This angle allows the end to remain in the outer mantle of the flame and causes it to be shortened naturally ,Irrelevant
If the wick is not treated it will burn too quickly and the flame will be extinguished by the melted wax ,Irrelevant
However if the wick burns tooslowly then the amount of exposed wick increases and the candle becomes dangerous ,Irrelevant
First the wax is heated and melted into a clear near liquid state in huge metal kettles ,Relevant
Wax melted by direct flame can become dark colored or can contain small pieces of carbon char ,Irrelevant
Next the molten wax must be carefully filtered to remove impurities that may interfere with the burning process ,Relevant
Any desired perfumes and dyes are added at this time ,Relevant
Although most wax arriving at the manufacturer conforms to strict purity standards many companies still filter their wax to be sure of a high quality finished product ,Relevant
Since the invention of Morgan s first candlemaking machine the construction of candles has been performed mainly by continuous molding machines although manual machines are still used by some companies ,Irrelevant
Continuous molding machines are designed to make candles in groups ranging anywhere from 50 to 500 per load ,Relevant
The entire process takes almost 30 minutes per load ,Irrelevant
Prior to the pouring of the wax the wick is pulled through the tip of the mold ,Relevant
This tip has a hole in it through which the wick passes from a spool located beneath the entire molding machine ,Irrelevant
The molds which are made of tin have polished interior surfaces and are slightly tapered for easier ejection of the finished candle ,Relevant
The wax is cooled to slightly above its melting point and poured into a molding table located above the molds ,Relevant
The wax then works its way into each mold the molds are pre heated so the wax will flow evenly into them ,Relevant
After the wax is poured a jacket around each mold is filled with cold water to speed up the solidification process ,Relevant
Once the wax has solidified the finished candles are pulled upwards out of the molds allowing the wicks to again thread through the molds in preparation for the next load of candles ,Relevant
The wicks are snipped and the process begins again ,Relevant
Excess wax is trimmed collected and re used ,Relevant
The continuous molding process is used to make cylindrical tapered or fluted candles as long as they can be easily ejected from the mold ,Relevant
An alternate method uses extrusion a process in which crushed paraffin wax is forced through a heated steel die under extreme pressure ,Irrelevant
At the same time the wax is consolidated around the wick ,Relevant
Unlike molding machines extrusion machines produce a continuous length of candle which is then cut into specific sizes ,Irrelevant
Next the tips of the candles are formed by rotation cutters and the candles are sent to an automated packing machine ,Relevant
A hydrocarbon such as petroleum oil and air are fed into a chamber ,Relevant
Part of the hydrocarbon undergoes incomplete combustion raising the temperature inside the chamberto 2 012 3 092 degrees Fahrenheit 1100 1 700 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
At this temperature the unburned hydrocarbon decomposes to carbon black ,Irrelevant
The newly created carbon black is routed to a cooler where it is sprayed with water ,Relevant
The fine black substance is then recovered using a centrifugal cyclone or a bag filter ,Relevant
A large roll of coating paper called the mill roll unwinds and passes over another roll the dope roll sitting in a pan of carbon ink ,Relevant
The ink pan has been heated to between 168 8 and 179 6 degrees Fahrenheit 76 and 82 degrees Celsius ,Irrelevant
As the paper passes over this roll the heated ink is transferred onto one side of the paper ,Relevant
Next the paper passes over an equalizer rod which scrapes the coated paper to smooth it out and remove excess ink ,Relevant
The equalizer rod may be either smooth or ridged ,Irrelevant
The paper then passes over another roll the chill roll which cools and solidifies the ink onto the paper ,Relevant
Finally the completed paper is rewound onto another roll ,Relevant
In the case of manifold business forms the carbon paper is glued to another form so the paper must have an uncoated strip without carbon where the adhesive can be applied ,Relevant
To accomplish this in the Mayer method a strip of metal is simply placed in the proper place on the dope roll ,Relevant
This part of the roll thus picks up no ink from the ink pan to pass onto the paper ,Relevant
Another method called the Flexographic method can also be used to produce one time carbon paper ,Irrelevant
First a dope roll is coated with carbon ink from a heated pan below it ,Relevant
A metering roll contacts the dope roll andsqueezes the ink to a uniform thickness ,Relevant
The ink is then transferred to a third roll the print roll ,Relevant
Meanwhile the paper is fed from a mill roll onto an impression roll that contacts the print roll the third roll mentioned in step #5 above ,Relevant
When these two rolls come into contact ink from the print roll is passed onto the paper on the impression roll ,Relevant
The paper then passes over a chill roll that solidifies the ink before being rolled onto the rewind roll ,Relevant
For manifold business forms being produced with the Flexographic method a shallow groove is formed on the print roll ,Relevant
Where this groove contacts the paper on the impression roll no ink gets transferred ,Irrelevant
The final stage in the manufacture of one time carbon paper is perforation ,Irrelevant
First the carbon and the printed forms are slitted while they are being collated ,Relevant
Next the huge rolls of carbon paper are cut into forms or sheets of the proper size ,Relevant
If necessary line holes can also be punched into the paper ,Relevant
All of these operations are carried out automatically by a spot carbonizer processing machine ,Irrelevant
Finally the paper is stacked boxed and shipped to the customer ,Relevant
First wood pulp or cotton seeds are broken down into cellulose fibers through both physical crushing and chemical decomposition ,Relevant
Next the raw cellulose fibers are treatedwith acetic acid and acetic anhydride to create a new compound triacetate ,Relevant
This material is then treated with a mixture of chemicals and water to produce the basic form of cellulose acetate ,Relevant
After being heated to remove all moisture the cellulose acetate is mixed with a plasticizing material similar to oil and the resulting cellulose acetate plastic is made into pellets orpelletized ,Relevant
The pellets are melted into a liquid and spread over a wide flat conveyer belt to form extremely thin plastic sheetsit would take about five such sheets to equal the thickness of common paper ,Relevant
The completed backing or film is then wound on large rolls several thousand yards long to await the application of the adhesive ,Relevant
Modern adhesives differ from their nineteenth century precursors in thatadhesomers the synthetic polymers they re based on are inherently sticky and so require no additional tackifying agents ,Irrelevant
Such polymers are made from crude oil distillate that is chemically reacted to form alcohols and acids ,Irrelevant
These materials are then mixed with a hydrocarbon solvent that catalyzes their polymerization the process by which they combine to form a complex molecular chain made up of repeating structural sequences ,Relevant
The resulting adhesomer may be used in this form or redissolved with more coating solvents depending on its intended application ,Relevant
It is then stored until needed ,Relevant
First the non adhesive side of the backing is treated with a release agent that makes the tape easy to unwind ,Relevant
Before the adhesive is applied to the sticky side the side may be treated with a primer to anchor the adhesive ,Relevant
This coating is applied by routing the film over a large roller that rotates in an open vat of primer ,Relevant
As the tape moves over the roller it applies the primer ,Relevant
Once these surface coats have been applied the tape travels over heated drums known as hot cans that dry it ,Relevant
A very thin layer of pressure sensitive adhesive is metered onto the primed side of the tape which is then rolled into long ovens for high temperature drying ,Relevant
Once dried the tape is wound onto large jumbo rolls and routed over slicers that divide it into varying widths ,Relevant
The individual bands of tape are then wound around a small plastic core which is next fitted inside a plastic dispenser whose serrated edge can be used to cut lengths of tape ,Relevant
Both tape rolls and dispensers come in a variety of sizes to fit varying customer needs ,Irrelevant
It is important to mix the right amounts together to achieve the desired properties ,Irrelevant
Batch calculations are thus required which must take into consideration both physical properties and chemical compositions of the raw materials ,Irrelevant
Once the appropriate weight of each raw material is determined the raw materials must be mixed together ,Relevant
Once the ingredients are weighed they are added together into a shell mixer ribbon mixer or intensive mixer ,Relevant
A shell mixer consists of two cylinders joined into a V which rotates to tumble and mix the material ,Irrelevant
A ribbon mixer uses helical vanes and an intensive mixer uses rapidly revolving plows ,Irrelevant
This step further grinds the ingredients resulting in a finer particle size that improves the subsequent forming process see step #4 below ,Irrelevant
If wet milling is first used the excess water is usually removed via spray drying ,Relevant
This involves pumping the slurry to an atomizer consisting of a rapidly rotating disk or nozzle ,Irrelevant
Droplets of the slip are dried as they are heated by a rising hot air column forming small free flowing granules that result in a powder suitable for forming ,Relevant
Most tile is formed by dry pressing ,Irrelevant
In this method the free flowing powdercontaining organic binder or a low percentage of moistureflows from a hopper into the forming die ,Irrelevant
The material is compressed in a steel cavity by steel plungers and is then ejected by the bottom plunger ,Relevant
Automated presses are used with operating pressures as high as 2 500 tons ,Irrelevant
Ceramic tile usually must be dried at high relative humidity after forming especially if a wet method is used ,Relevant
Drying which can take several days removes the water at a slow enough rate to prevent shrinkage cracks ,Irrelevant
Continuous or tunnel driers are used that are heated using gas or oil infrared lamps or microwave energy ,Relevant
Infrared drying is better suited for thin tile whereas microwave drying works better for thicker tile ,Irrelevant
Another method impulse drying uses pulses of hot air flowing in the transverse direction instead of continuously in the material flow direction ,Irrelevant
To prepare the glaze similar methods are used as for the tile body ,Irrelevant
After a batch formulation is calculated the raw materials are weighed mixed and dry or wet milled ,Relevant
The milled glazes are then applied using one of the many methods available ,Relevant
In centrifugal glazing or discing the glaze is fed through a rotating disc that flings or throws the glaze onto the tile ,Relevant
In the bell waterfall method a stream of glaze falls onto the tile as it passes on a conveyor underneath ,Relevant
Sometimes the glaze is simply sprayed on ,Irrelevant
For multiple glaze applications screen printing on under or between tile that have been wet glazed is used ,Relevant
In this process glaze is forced through a screen by a rubber squeegee or other device ,Relevant
After glazing the tile must be heated intensely to strengthen it and give it the desired porosity ,Relevant
Two types of ovens orkilns are used for firing tile ,Irrelevant
Wall tile or tile that is prepared by dry grinding instead of wet milling see #2 and #3 above usually requires a two step process ,Relevant
In this process the tile goes through a low temperature firing called bisque firing before glazing ,Irrelevant
This step removes the volatiles from the material and most or all of the shrinkage ,Irrelevant
The body and glaze are then fired together in a process called glost firing ,Relevant
Both firing processes take place in a tunnel or continuous kiln which consists of a chamber through which the ware is slowly moved on a conveyor on refractory battsshelves built of materials that are resistant to high temperaturesor in containers called saggers ,Irrelevant
Firing in a tunnel kiln can take two to three days with firing temperatures around 2 372 degrees Fahrenheit 1 300 degrees Celsius ,Irrelevant
After firing and testing the tile is ready to be packaged and shipped ,Relevant
Approximately 95 percent of the limestone produced in the United States is quarried ,Irrelevant
After a sufficient reserve twenty five years worth is recommended has been prospected the land that covers the deposit is removed with bulldozers and scrapers ,Relevant
If the chalk is close to the surface an open shelf quarry method can be used however this is very rare ,Relevant
Usually an open pit quarry method is used instead ,Irrelevant
Holes are drilled into the rock explosives are placed inside and the rock is blown apart ,Relevant
Depending on the nature of the deposit a pit can be enlarged laterally or vertically ,Relevant
Once comparatively large chunks of limestone have been quarried they need to be transported to crushing machines where they are pulverized to meet the demands of the chalk industry ,Relevant
The first step is primary crushing ,Relevant
Various crushers exist but the principle is the same all compress the stone with jaws or a cone or shatter it through impact ,Irrelevant
Secondary crushing is accomplished by smaller crushers that work at higher speeds producing pebbles which are then ground and pulverized ,Relevant
The next phase wet grinding washes away impurities ,Relevant
It is used to make the fine grade of limestone necessary to make chalk suitable for writing purposes ,Irrelevant
Wet grinding is carried out in ball millsrotating steel drums with steel balls inside that pulverize the chalk until it is very fine ,Irrelevant
Gypsum like limestone is also quarried and pulverized ,Relevant
The major difference in processing gypsum is that it must be dehydrated to form calcium sulfate the major component of colored chalk ,Irrelevant
This is done in a kettle a large combustion chamber in which the gypsum is heated to between 244 and 253 degrees Fahrenheit 116 121 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
It is allowed to boil until it has been reduced by twelve to fifteen percent at which point its water content will have been reduced from 20 9 percent to between 5 and 6 percent ,Relevant
To further reduce the water the gypsum is reheated to about 402 degrees Fahrenheit 204 degrees Celsius at which point it is removed from the kettle ,Relevant
By now almost all of the water has evaporated leaving calcium sulfate ,Irrelevant
The particles of chalk or calcium sulfate are now conveyed to vibrating screens that sift out the finer material ,Relevant
The ensuing fine chalk is then washed dried packed in bags and shipped to the manufacturer ,Relevant
Upon receiving chalk or calcium sulfate the chalk factory usually grinds the materials again to render them smooth and uniformly fine ,Relevant
To make white classroom chalk the manufacturer adds water to form a thick slurry with the consistency of clay ,Relevant
The slurry is then placed into and extruded from a diean orifice of the desired long thin shape ,Relevant
Cut into lengths of approximately 24 43 inches 62 centimeters the sticks are next placed on a sheet that contains places for five such sticks ,Relevant
The sheet is then placed in an oven where the chalk cures for four days at 188 degrees Fahrenheit 85 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
After it has cured the sticks are cut into 80 millimeters lengths ,Relevant
Pigments dry natural colored materials are mixed in with the calcium carbonate while both are dry the procedure is similar to sifting flour and baking powder together before adding liquid as in a cake recipe ,Relevant
Water is then added to the mixture which is then baked in the same manner as white classroom chalk ,Relevant
Placed in small boxes the completed chalk sticks are stacked in large boxes to be shipped to supply stores ,Relevant
Although cheese making is a linear process it involves many factors ,Irrelevant
Numerous varieties of cheese exist because ending the simple preparation process at different points can produce different cheeses as can varying additives or procedures ,Irrelevant
Cheese making has long been considered a delicate process ,Irrelevant
Attempts to duplicate the success of an old cheese factory have been known to fail because conditions at a new factory do not favor the growth of the proper bacteria ,Irrelevant
Small cheese factories accept either morning milk which is richer evening milk or both ,Irrelevant
Because it is generally purchased from small dairies which don t pasteurize this milk contains the bacteria necessary to produce lactic acid one of the agents that triggers curdling ,Irrelevant
The cheese makers let the milk sit until enough lactic acid has formed to begin producing the particular type of cheese they re making ,Relevant
Depending on the type of cheese being produced the cheese makers may then heat the ripening milk ,Relevant
This process differs slightly at large cheese factories which purchase pasteurized milk and must consequently add a culture of bacteria to produce lactic acid ,Irrelevant
The next step is to add animal or vegetable rennet to the milk furthering its separation into curds and whey ,Relevant
Once formed the curds are cut both vertically and horizontally with knives ,Relevant
In large factories huge vats of curdled milk are cut vertically using sharp multi bladed wire knives reminiscent of oven racks ,Relevant
The same machine then agitates the curds and slices them horizontally ,Relevant
If the cutting is done manually the curds are cut both ways using a large two handled knife ,Relevant
Soft cheeses are cut into big chunks while hard cheeses are cut into tiny chunks ,Relevant
For cheddar for instance the space between the knives is about one twentieth of an inch [half a centimeter] ,Irrelevant
After cutting the curds may be heated to hasten the separationfrom the whey but they are more typically left alone ,Relevant
When separation is complete the whey is drained ,Relevant
Moisture must then be removed from the curds although the amount removed depends on the type of cheese ,Relevant
For some types with high moisture contents the whey draining process removes sufficient moisture ,Relevant
Other types require the curds to be cut heated and or filtered to get rid of excess moisture ,Relevant
To make cheddar cheese for example cheese makerscheddar or finely chop the curd ,Irrelevant
To make hard dry cheeses such as parmesan cheese makers first cheddar and then cook the curd ,Irrelevant
Regardless if the curds are to be aged they are then put into molds ,Relevant
Here they are pressed to give the proper shape and size ,Relevant
Soft cheeses such as cottage cheese are not aged ,Relevant
At this stage the cheese may be inoculated with a flavoring mold bathed in brine or wrapped in cloth or hay before being deposited in a place of the proper temperature and humidity to age ,Relevant
Some cheeses are aged for a month some for up to several years ,Relevant
Ageing sharpens the flavor of the cheese for example cheddar aged more than two years is appropriately labeled extra sharp ,Irrelevant
Some cheeses may develop a rind naturally as their surfaces dry ,Irrelevant
Other rinds may form from the growth of bacteria that has been sprayed on the surface of the cheese ,Irrelevant
Still other cheeses are washed and this process encourages bacterial growth ,Relevant
In place of or in addition to rinds cheeses can be sealed in cloth or wax ,Relevant
For local eating this may be all the packaging that is necessary ,Relevant
However large quantities of cheese are packaged for sale in distant countries ,Relevant
Such cheeses may be heavily salted for export such as Roquefort or sealed in impermeable plastic or foil ,Relevant
Edible yet inferior cheeses can be saved and made into processed cheese ,Relevant
Cheeses such as Emmental commonly called Swiss Gruyere similar to Swiss Colby or cheddar are cut up and very finely ground ,Irrelevant
After this powder has been mixed with water to form a paste other ingredients such as salt fillers emulsifiers preservatives and flavorings are added ,Relevant
The mixture is then heated under controlled conditions ,Relevant
While still warm and soft the cheese paste is extruded into long ribbons that are sliced ,Relevant
The small sheets of cheese are then put onto a plastic or foil sheet and wrapped by a machine ,Relevant
While the specific ingredients in gum might be a secret the process for making gum is not ,Irrelevant
The first chewing gum making machine wasn t even patented and today the procedure is considered standard throughout the industry ,Irrelevant
If natural latex is to be used it must first be harvested and processed ,Relevant
The tall 32 79 yard 30 meter chicle tree is scored with a series of shallow Xs enabling the chicle to flow down into a bucket ,Relevant
After a significantamount of chicle has accumulated it is strained and placed in large kettles ,Relevant
Stirred constantly it is boiled until it reduces to two thirds of its original volume ,Relevant
It is then poured into greased wooden molds and shipped ,Relevant
The natural and or artificial gum bases are first ground into a coarse meal and mixed to ensure uniform consistency ,Relevant
The blend is then placed in a warm room to dry for a day or two ,Relevant
During drying hot air continually passes over the mixture ,Relevant
Next the gum base is cooked in kettles at 243 degrees Fahrenheit 116 degrees Celsius until it has melted into a thick syrup ,Relevant
To purify it workers pass it through screens and place it in a high speed centrifuge before refiltering it this time through finer screens ,Relevant
The gum base is now ready for additives ,Irrelevant
It is placed in kettles to be cooked and additional ingredients are stirred in by large steel blades ,Relevant
First extremely fine powdered sugar and corn syrup are added ,Relevant
Flavorings are added next followed by softeners ,Relevant
When the mixture is smooth enough it is rolled out onto belts and cooled by being exposed to cold air ,Relevant
The next step is kneading ,Irrelevant
For several hours machines gently pummel the massof chewing gum until it is properly rubbery and smooth ,Relevant
Large chunks are then chopped off the mass to be flattened by rollers until they reach the proper thickness of nearly 17 inches about 43 cm ,Relevant
During this process the sheet of chewing gum is dusted with powdered sugar to prepare it for cutting ,Relevant
A cutting machine first scores the sheet in a pattern of rectangles each 1 3 inches 3 3 centimeters long and 449 of an inch 1 14 centimeters wide ,Relevant
The sheet is then put aside at the proper temperature and humidity to season ,Relevant
Once seasoned the gum sheets are broken into sticks wrapped inaluminum foilor wax paper wrapped in paper and put into plastic packs that are then sealed ,Relevant
Put into boxes or plastic bags the gum is ready to be shipped to retail outlets ,Relevant
Amazingly gum balls make up only three percent of chewing gum sales yet their unique merchandising makes them intriguing ,Irrelevant
Gumballs are made by scoring a cylinder of gum twice to form balls which are then stored several hours at 55 60 degrees Fahrenheit 13 16 degrees Celsius to harden ,Relevant
The balls are put into huge kettles to be coated with a flavored and colored sucrose solution ,Relevant
After seven hours the coated balls are dried with hot air then rolled in beeswax or other wax to make them shiny ,Relevant
The nature of gumball machines determined the next step ,Irrelevant
An enclosed plastic globe is subject to interior condensation ,Relevant
The water collected ruins untreated gumballs so they are usually coated with a plastic water repellent glaze to protect them ,Relevant
Candy coated gums are made in essentially the same way their final destination being boxes not gum ball machines ,Relevant
A recent development has been the introduction of gums with a liquid center ,Relevant
To make this gum the gum base is extruded to form a hollow rope ,Relevant
The liquid is then fed into the hollow area and a cutting machine chops the ropes into bite size pieces and wraps them ,Relevant
Once a company has received a shipment of cocoa beans at its processing plant the beans are roasted first on screens and then in revolving cylinders through which heated air is blown ,Relevant
Over a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours the moisture in the beans is reduced from about seven percent to about one percent ,Relevant
The roasting process triggers a browning reaction in which more than 300 different chemicals present in the cocoa beans interact ,Relevant
The beans now begin to develop the rich flavor we associate with chocolate ,Irrelevant
Roasting also causes the shells to open and break away from the nibs the meat of the bean ,Relevant
This separation process can be completed by blowing air across the beans as they go through a giant winnowing machine called a cracker and fanner which loosens the hulls from the beans without crushing them ,Irrelevant
The hulls now separated from the nibs are usually sold as either mulch or fertilizer ,Relevant
They are also sometimes used as a commercial boiler fuel ,Irrelevant
Next the roasted nibs undergobroyage a process of crushing that takes place in a grinder made of revolving granite blocks ,Relevant
The design of the grinder may vary but most resemble old fashioned flour mills ,Irrelevant
The final product of this grinding process made up of small particles of the nib suspended in oil is a thick syrup known as chocolate liquor ,Irrelevant
The next step is refining during which the liquor is further ground between sets of revolving metal drums ,Relevant
Each successive rolling is faster than the preceding one because the liquor is becoming smoother and flows easier ,Relevant
The ultimate goal is to reduce the size of the particles in the liquor to about 001 inch 00254 centimeters ,Irrelevant
If the chocolate being produced is to be cocoa powder from which hot chocolate and baking mixes are made the chocolate liquor may bedutched a process so named because it was invented by the Dutch chocolate maker Conrad van Houten ,Relevant
In the dutching process the liquor is treated with an alkaline solution usually potassium carbonate that raises its pH from 5 5 to 7 or 8 ,Relevant
This increase darkens the color of the cocoa renders its flavor more mild and reduces the tendency of the nib particles to form clumps in the liquor ,Relevant
The powder that eventually ensues is called dutch cocoa ,Irrelevant
The next step in making cocoa powder isdefattingthe chocolate liquor or removing large amounts of butter from it ,Relevant
This is done by further compressing the liquor between rollers until about half of the fat from its cocoa beans has been released ,Relevant
The resulting solid material commonly calledpress cake is then broken chopped or crushed before being sifted to produce cocoa powder ,Relevant
When additives such as sugar or other sweeteners have been blended this cocoa powder becomes a modern version of chocalatl ,Relevant
If the chocolate being produced is to become candy the press cake is remixed with some of the removed cocoa butter ,Relevant
The restored cocoa butter is necessary for texture and consistency and different types of chocolate require different amounts of cocoa butter ,Irrelevant
The mixture now undergoes a process known asconching in which it is continuously turned and ground in a huge open vat ,Relevant
The process s name derives from older vats which resembled large conch shells ,Irrelevant
The conching process can last from between three hours to three days more time is not necessarily better however ,Relevant
This is the most important step in making chocolate ,Irrelevant
The speed and temperature of the mixing are critical in determining the quality of the final product ,Irrelevant
Another crucial aspect of conching is the time and rate at which other ingredients are added ,Irrelevant
The ingredients added during conching determine what type of chocolate is produced sweet chocolate consists of chocolate liquor cocoa butter sugar and vanilla milk chocolate contains sweet chocolate with powdered whole milk or whole liquid milk ,Irrelevant
At the end of the conching process the chocolate is poured into molds cooled cut and wrapped ,Relevant
First the coffee cherries must be harvested a process that is still done manually ,Relevant
Next the cherries are dried and husked using one of two methods ,Relevant
The dry method is an older primitive and labor intensive process of distributing the cherries in the sun raking them several times a day and allowing them to dry ,Relevant
When they have dried to the point at which they contain only 12 percent water the beans husks become shriveled ,Relevant
At this stage they are hulled either by hand or by a machine ,Relevant
In employing the wet method the hulls are removed before the beans have dried ,Relevant
Although the fruit is initially processed in a pulping machine that removes most of the material surrounding the beans some of this glutinous covering remains after pulping ,Relevant
This residue is removed by letting the beans ferment in tanks where their natural enzymes digest the gluey substance over a period of 18 to 36 hours ,Relevant
Upon removal from the fermenting tank the beans are washed dried by exposure to hot air and put into large mechanical stirrers calledhullers ,Relevant
There the beans last parchment covering the pergamino crumbles and falls away easily ,Irrelevant
The huller then polishes the bean to a clean glossy finish ,Relevant
The beans are then placed on a conveyor belt that carries them past workers who remove sticks and other debris ,Relevant
Next they are graded according to size the location and altitude of the plantation where they were grown drying and husking methods and taste ,Relevant
All these factors contribute to certain flavors that consumers will be able to select thanks in part to the grade ,Irrelevant
Once these processes are completed workers select and pack particular types and grades of beans to fill orders from the various roasting companies that will finish preparing the beans ,Relevant
When beans usuallyrobusta are harvested under the undesirable conditions of hot humid countries or coastal regions they must be shipped as quickly as possible because such climates encourage insects and fungi that can severely damage a shipment ,Relevant
When the coffee beans arrive at a roasting plant they are again cleaned and sorted by mechanical screening devices to remove leaves bark and other remaining debris ,Relevant
If the beans are not to be decaffeinated they are ready for roasting ,Relevant
If the coffee is to be decaffeinated it is now processed using either a solvent or a water method ,Relevant
In the first process the coffee beans are treated with a solvent usually methylene chloride that leaches out the caffeine ,Relevant
If this decaffeination method is used the beans must be thoroughly washed to remove traces of the solvent prior to roasting ,Relevant
The other method entails steaming the beans to bring the caffeine to the surface and then scraping off this caffeine rich layer ,Relevant
The beans are roasted in huge commercial roasters according to procedures and specifications which vary among manufacturers specialty shops usually purchase beans directly from the growers and roast them on site ,Relevant
The most common process entails placing the beans in a large metal cylinder and blowing hot air into it ,Relevant
An older method calledsingeing calls for placing the beans in a metal cylinder that is then rotated over an electric gas or charcoal heater ,Irrelevant
Regardless of the particular method used roasting gradually raises the temperature of the beans to between 431 and 449 degrees Fahrenheit 220 230 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
This triggers the release of steam carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and other volatiles reducing the weight of the beans by 14 to 23 percent ,Relevant
The pressure of these escaping internal gases causes the beans to swell and they increase their volume by 30 to 100 percent ,Relevant
Roasting also darkens the color of the beans gives them a crumbly texture and triggers the chemical reactions that imbue the coffee with its familiar aroma which it has not heretofore possessed ,Irrelevant
After leaving the roaster the beans are placed in a cooling vat wherein they are stirred while cold air is blown over them ,Relevant
If the coffee being prepared is high quality the cooled beans will now be sent through an electronic sorter equipped to detect and eliminate beans that emerged from the roasting process too light or too dark ,Relevant
If the coffee is to be pre ground the manufacturer mills it immediately after roasting ,Relevant
Special types of grinding have been developed for each of the different types of coffee makers as each functions best with coffee ground to a specific fineness ,Irrelevant
If the coffee is to be instant it is I V brewed with water in huge percolators after the grinding stage ,Relevant
An extract is clarified from the brewed coffee and sprayed into a large cylinder ,Relevant
As it falls downward through this cylinder it enters a warm air stream that converts it into a dry powder ,Relevant
Because it is less vulnerable to flavor and aroma loss than other types of coffee whole bean coffee is usually packaged in foil lined bags ,Relevant
If it is to retain its aromatic qualities pre ground coffee must be hermetically sealed it is usually packaged in impermeable plastic film aluminum foil or cans ,Relevant
Instant coffee picks up moisture easily so it is vacuum packed in tin cans or glass jars before being shipped to retail stores ,Relevant
The twenty component parts of the typical combination lock are formed drawn cut pressed and molded on a variety of machines both manual and automatic ,Relevant
The lever locking latch and disc shaft are all made by injection molding a process in which molten zamak is poured into a mold and subjected to heat and pressure until it solidifies into the shape of the mold ,Relevant
Although the post is shaped at room temperature it is also formed under high pressure ,Relevant
The combination disc and the cam are made of cold rolledpassed under huge rolls without being heatedflat strip steel after being cold rolled the steel is put in a blanking die a sophisticated cookie cutter which cuts or blanks out the properly shaped piece ,Relevant
The internal disc spring is made from stainless steel round wire and produced on a spring winder that automatically twists and turns the wire to form the traditional coil spring ,Irrelevant
The shackle collar like the combination disc and cam is made from cold rolled flat strip steel that is blanked in a blanking die ,Irrelevant
The inner case is produced from flat steel strip and drawn to a cup configuration ,Irrelevant
This process requires great pressure to stretch and compress the material as it is pressed or drawn around a die whose shape it takes ,Relevant
The outer case is manufactured similarly to the inner case but from stainless steel sheet instead of strip ,Relevant
The back cover also stainless steel is blanked in a blanking die ,Relevant
The durable shackle is made of round bar stock and machined on a screw machine then formed to its U shape and notched to accept the locking latch ,Irrelevant
It is finally annealed heated to great temperature before being quenched in water to make it resistant to hacksaws and bolt cutters ,Relevant
The combination dial also zamak is injection molded then chromized ,Relevant
This process involves heating the part in a salt bath rich in chromium ,Relevant
The steel absorbs the chromium which hardens on the surface as it cools rapidly ,Relevant
The dial is painted black and white wiped which leaves the numbers highlighted against the black face ,Relevant
Several plating and finishing processes can be used to protect the components against corrosion ,Relevant
The lever disc shaft combination cam and dial are chromized ,Relevant
The inner case shackle collar and lever post are all cadmium plated ,Relevant
The shackle and locking latch are copper nickel plated ,Relevant
The outer case of stainless steel is mechanically polished to enhance luster ,Relevant
Assembly of the components is precise with the back plate disc shaft combination cam and spacers forming one subassembly ,Relevant
The outer and inner cases are riveted together and then pierced at the point where the shackle is inserted ,Relevant
The combination dial outer and inner case unit and combination cam are then fastened together ,Relevant
Finally these sub assemblies and the remaining parts are fitted together ,Relevant
The lock case is closed and the edges folded over and sealed ,Relevant
Conventional hardware fasteners that can be released with the proper tool are not used ,Irrelevant
The remaining operation is the application of a removable tag or label to the lock ,Relevant
On this tag is the combination determined randomly by machine draw ,Irrelevant
Lock manufacturers today jealously guard their combination setting procedures ,Irrelevant
A typical combination lock is sold in blister pack a rigid molded plastic with cardboard backing although locks may also be individually boxed ,Relevant
Manufacturing a combine begins with the delivery of large coils of sheet steel to the sheet metal shop ,Relevant
The coil steel is loaded into one of several machines that make up the cut to length line in the sheet metal shop ,Relevant
Computer controlled rollers pull the steel from the coil flatten it and feed it into a cutting machine ,Relevant
The steel is cut into blanks basic rectangular shapes that are later welded together to form the body of the combine and the top mounted grain tank ,Relevant
For maximum efficiency the cut to length line operates on pre determined batch schedules ,Relevant
The basic metal shapes cut from the steel coils are used during the day or week that they are cut so there is no storage of basic components ,Relevant
From the cut to length line the blanks are moved to the cut to shape line ,Relevant
In a laser punch press an industrial laser cuts complex shapes from them and drills holes for shafts piping and bolts ,Relevant
Then the press exerts up to 1 000 tons of pressure to bend the steel into final form ,Relevant
Small batches of parts are moved from the sheet metal shop to the welding area where cellular manufacturing techniques are used for speed and quality control ,Relevant
In cellular manufacturing several manufacturing functions are grouped in one area so parts can be quickly passed from one operation to the next and several subcomponents are loaded on a transportation skid before being sent to the next assembly step ,Relevant
Thus all the parts needed to assemble a batch of components are present when the skid arrives ,Relevant
To further enhance efficiency much of the welding of sheet steel components is done by powerful computer controlled units ,Relevant
Hydraulic lifts properly position components that are then welded by one armed robots ,Relevant
As the smaller components of the combine are assembled the body begins to take shape ,Relevant
In the form of a simple frame it is now attached to an overhead loadbar conveyor track that carries it through the remainder of the production process ,Relevant
After the body has been welded the overhead conveyor transports it to and submerges it in the paint tank a huge 48 000 gallon 181 776 liters tank full of electrostatically charged paint ,Relevant
Because combines are used and stored outside their paint must be able to resist the harmful effects of sunshine and moisture and the electrostatic process insures that it will ,Irrelevant
In electrostatic painting the metal combine body is given a positive electrical charge while the water based paint is given a negative charge ,Relevant
Because opposite electrical charges are attracted to each other the positively charged body attracts the negatively charged paint causing the paint to bond to the combine tightly and completely only rubber gaskets and other non metallic parts are not touched by the paint ,Irrelevant
After the conveyor lifts the combine body from the paint bath it suspends it over the tank for a few moments so that excess paint can drip off ,Relevant
The body is then moved into a 363 degree Fahrenheit 182 degrees Celsius oven where the paint is baked to a hard rust resistant finish ,Relevant
After painting the combine body is carried through the assembly line so that other major components may be installed ,Relevant
Where necessary these components have also been dipped in the electrostatic paint bath ,Relevant
Once the axles hubs and tires have been added the combine is removed from the overhead conveyor and is towed from station to station ,Relevant
After the combine body the other significant structural assembly is the grain tank ,Irrelevant
In the grain tank assembly area skilled workers use a complex positioning and welding system to complete more than 500 separate welds in two 10 Y2 minute sequences ,Irrelevant
Automated sheet metal handling equipment pulls flat sheets from skids fresh from the cut to shape line in the sheet metal shop ,Irrelevant
These sheets are then loaded onto a huge metal table the size of a two car garage ,Relevant
Next hydraulic cylinders position the side panels as human welders scramble to secure the corners of the grain tank with tack welds ,Relevant
When the human welders are out of harm s way robot arms swing into action making hundreds of welds in a few minutes ,Relevant
After the body and grain tank have been painted they are brought to the final assembly line where 22 different assembly operations are performed ,Relevant
Major components like the engine module are installed wiring and hydraulic lines are connected and all systems are tested ,Relevant
Oil anti freeze and gas are added and the engine is started ,Relevant
On the outside a final coating of clear polyurethane is applied across the top of the wide flat surfaces of the cab grain tank and engine module and decals are applied ,Relevant
Compact discs must be manufactured under very clean and dust free conditions in a clean room which is kept free from virtually all dust particles ,Irrelevant
The air in the room is specially filtered to keep out dirt and occupants of the room must wear special clothing ,Relevant
Because an average dust particle is 100 times larger than the average pit and land on a CD even the smallest dust particle can render a disc useless ,Irrelevant
The original music is first recorded onto a digital audio tape ,Relevant
Next the audio program is transferred to a 3 4 inch 1 9 centimeters video tape and then data called subcodes used for indexing and tracking the music is added to the audio data on the tape ,Relevant
At this point the tape is called a pre master ,Irrelevant
The pre master tape will be used to create the disc master also called the glass master which is a disc made from specially prepared glass ,Irrelevant
The glass is polished to a smooth finish and coated with a layer of adhesive and a layer of photoresist material ,Relevant
The disc is approximately 9 45 inches 240 millimeters in diameter and 24 of an inch six millimeters thick ,Irrelevant
After the adhesive and photoresist are applied the disc is cured in an oven ,Relevant
Next both the pre master tape and the disc master are put into a complex laser cutting machine ,Relevant
The machine plays back the audio program on the pre master tape ,Relevant
As it does so the program is transferred to a device called a CD encoder which in turn generates an electrical signal ,Relevant
This signal powers a laser beam which exposes or cuts grooves into the photoresist coating on the glass disc the disc master ,Relevant
The grooves that have been exposed are then etched away by chemicals these etched grooves will form the pits of the CD s surface ,Relevant
A metal coating usually silver is then applied to the disc ,Relevant
The disc master now contains the exact pit and land track that the finished CD will have ,Irrelevant
After etching the disc master undergoes a process called electroforming in which another metal layer such as nickel is deposited onto the disc s surface ,Relevant
The phrase electro is used because the metal is deposited using an electric current ,Irrelevant
The disc is bathed in an electrolytic solution such as nickel solphamate and as the electric current is applied a layer of metal forms on the disc master ,Relevant
The thickness of this metal layer is strictly controlled ,Relevant
Next the newly applied metal layer is pulled apart from the disc master which is put aside ,Relevant
The metal layer or father contains a negative impression of the disc master track in other words the track on the metal layer is an exact replica but in reverse of the track on the disc master ,Relevant
The metal father then undergoes further electroforming to produce one or more mothers which are simply metal layers that again have positive impressions of the original disc master track ,Relevant
Using the same electroforming process each mother then produces a son also called a stamper with a negative impression of the track ,Relevant
It is the son that is then used to create the actual CD ,Relevant
After being separated from the mother the metal son is rinsed dried polished and put in a punching machine that cuts out the center hole and forms the desired outside diameter ,Relevant
The metal son is then put into a hollow cavitya dieof the proper disc shape in an injection molding machine ,Relevant
Molten polycarbonate plastic is then poured into this die to form around the metal son ,Relevant
Once cooled the plastic is shaped like the son with the pits and groovesonce again in a positive impression of the original disc master trackformed into one side ,Relevant
The center hole is then punched out of plastic disc which is transparent atthis stage ,Relevant
Next the disc is scanned for flaws such as water bubbles dust particles and warps ,Relevant
If a flaw is found the disc must be discarded ,Relevant
If the disc meets the quality standards I it is then coated with an extremely thin reflective layer of aluminum ,Relevant
The coating is applied using vacuum deposition ,Relevant
In this process aluminum is put into a vacuum chamber and heated to the point of evaporation which allows it to be applied evenly to the plastic disc ,Relevant
Finally a clear acrylic plastic is applied to the disc to help protect the underlying layers from physical damage such as scratches ,Relevant
After the label is printed generally using a silk screening process the compact disc is complete and ready for packaging and shipment ,Relevant
Purchased from outside contractors the laser and the photodiode are installed beneath the disc clamp ,Relevant
The various lenses and mirrors in the assembly must be properly spaced and aligned so that they can focus and direct light as necessary ,Relevant
The whole assembly is then housed in a plastic case ,Relevant
The case is made by the one of the usual plastic forming processes such as extrusion or injection molding while the lenses and mirrors usually silicon are cut into the proper shape and then finely polished with abrasives ,Relevant
The semiconducting photodiode is made by preparing and polishing a substance such as silicon or germanium and then adding impurities to create layers ,Irrelevant
Electrical contacts are then added ,Relevant
After the optical components are in position the gears and belt that will help to position the optical pick up are put in place ,Relevant
Next the motor that will move the optical pick up is connected to the gears and belt and placed on the chassis ,Relevant
The loading tray is now centered and the spindle motor that will rotate the disc is installed ,Irrelevant
After the clamp to which the optical pick up has been attached is positioned adjacent to the loading tray the tray clamp and pick up motor are installed in the loading drawer which is placed in the CD player s cabinet ,Relevant
Last to be assembled are the electronic components ,Irrelevant
Designed by engineers using computer aided design CAD packages the circuit boards consist of a copper clad base that has a pattern transferred onto itmasking through screen printing or a similar method ,Irrelevant
After being coated with a photosensitive material the patterned areas are etched away chemically to create a multi layered boardthe layers comprise the various transistors and capacitors that make up the circuits ,Relevant
The tiny microchips usually made of silicon that are mounted on the board are made in the same way except on a much smaller scale ,Irrelevant
Depending on the manufacturer the CD player may have one large circuit board or several smaller boards ,Irrelevant
After they have been attached to the panel or panels the circuits are attached to the CD player s front control panel the switch assembly and finally the power supply ,Relevant
Once the various subassemblies are ready they are connected and interfaced together to complete the final assembly ,Relevant
Most of the work performed at this stage is done by human workers ,Irrelevant
The CD player is now tested and sent for packaging ,Relevant
The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple ,Irrelevant
First the cement usually Portland cement is prepared ,Relevant
Next the other ingredientsaggregates such as sand or gravel admixtures chemical additives any necessary fibers and waterare mixed together with the cement to form concrete ,Relevant
The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed compacted and cured ,Relevant
The limestone silica and alumina that make up Portland cement are dry ground into a very fine powder mixed together in predetermined proportions preheated and calcined heated to a high temperature that will burn off impurities without fusing the ingredients ,Relevant
Next the material is burned in a large rotary kiln at 2 550 degrees Fahrenheit 1 400 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
At this temperature the material partially fuses into a substance known as clinker ,Irrelevant
A modern kiln can produce as much as 6 200 tons of clinker a day ,Irrelevant
The clinker is then cooled and ground to a fine powder in a tube or ball mill ,Relevant
A ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes depending on the desired fineness of the cement that crush and grind the clinker ,Relevant
Gypsum is added during the grinding process ,Relevant
The final composition consists of several compounds tricalcium silicate dicalcium silicate tricalcium aluminate and tetracalcium aluminoferrite ,Irrelevant
The cement is then mixed with the other ingredients aggregates sand gravel or crushed stone admixtures fibers and water ,Relevant
Aggregates are pre blended or added at the ready mix concrete plant under normal operating conditions ,Relevant
The mixing operation uses rotation or stirring to coat the surface of the aggregate with cement paste and to blend the other ingredients uniformly ,Irrelevant
A variety of batch or continuous mixers are used ,Irrelevant
Fibers if desired can be added by a variety of methods including direct spraying premixing impregnating or hand laying up ,Relevant
Silica fume is often used as a dispersing or densifying agent ,Relevant
Once the concrete mixture is ready it is transported to the work site ,Relevant
There are many methods of transporting concrete including wheelbarrows buckets belt conveyors special trucks and pumping ,Irrelevant
Pumping transports large quantities of concrete over large distances through pipelines using a system consisting of a hopper a pump and the pipes ,Relevant
Pumps come in several typesthe horizontal piston pump with semi rotary valves and small portable pumps called squeeze pumps ,Irrelevant
A vacuum provides a continuous flow of concrete with two rotating rollers squeezing a flexible pipe to move the concrete into the delivery pipe ,Irrelevant
Once at the site the concrete must be placed and compacted ,Relevant
These two operations are performed almost simultaneously ,Relevant
Placing must be done so that segregation of the various ingredients is avoided and full compactionwith all air bubbles eliminatedcan be achieved ,Relevant
Whether chutes or buggies are used position is important in achieving these goals ,Relevant
The rates of placing and of compaction should be equal the latter is usually accomplished using internal or external vibrators ,Irrelevant
An internal vibrator uses a poker housing a motor driven shaft ,Irrelevant
When the poker is inserted into the concrete controlled vibration occurs to compact the concrete ,Relevant
External vibrators are used for precast or thin in situ sections having a shape or thickness unsuitable for internal vibrators ,Relevant
These type of vibrators are rigidly clamped to the formwork which rests on an elastic support ,Irrelevant
Both the form and the concrete are vibrated ,Relevant
Vibrating tables are also used where a table produces vertical vibration by using two shafts rotating in opposite directions ,Relevant
Once it is placed and compacted the concrete must cured before it is finished to make sure that it doesn t dry too quickly ,Relevant
Concrete s strength is influenced by its moisture level during the hardening process as the cement solidifies the concrete shrinks ,Irrelevant
If site constraints prevent the concrete from contracting tensile stresses will develop weakening the concrete ,Irrelevant
To minimize this problem concrete must be kept damp during the several days it requires to set and harden ,Relevant
Incoming oil seeds are passed over magnets to remove any trace metal before being dehulled deskinned or otherwise stripped of all extraneous material ,Relevant
In the case of cotton the ginned seeds must be stripped of their lint as well as dehulled ,Relevant
In the case of corn the kernel must undergo milling to separate the germ ,Relevant
The stripped seeds or nuts are then ground into coarse meal to provide more surface area to be pressed ,Relevant
Mechanized grooved rollers or hammer mills crush the material to the proper consistency ,Relevant
The meal is then heated to facilitate the extraction of the oil ,Relevant
While the procedure allows more oil to be pressed out more impurities are also pressed out with the oil and these must be removed before the oil can be deemed edible ,Relevant
The heated meal is then fed continuously into a screw press which increases the pressure progressively as the meal passes through a slotted barrel ,Relevant
Pressure generally increases from 68 950 to 20 6850 kilopascals as the oil is squeezed out from the slots in the barrel where it can be recovered ,Relevant
Soybeans are usually not pressed at all before solvent extraction because they have relatively little oil but most oil seeds with more oil are pressed and solvent treated ,Relevant
After the initial oil has been recovered from the screw press theoil cakeremaining in the press is processed by solvent extraction to attain the maximum yield ,Relevant
A volatile hydrocarbon most commonly hexane dissolves the oil out of the oil cake which is then recovered by distilling the light solvent out ,Relevant
The Blaw Knox Rotocell is used to meet the demands of the United States soybean oil industry ,Relevant
In using this machine flakes of meal are sent through wedge shaped cells of a cylindrical vessel ,Relevant
The solvent then passes through the matter to be collected at the bottom ,Relevant
Also still in use by a significant number of manufacturers is the Bollman or Hansa Muhle unit in which oilseed flakes are placed in perforated baskets that circulate continuously ,Relevant
The solvent percolates through the matter which is periodically dumped and replaced ,Relevant
Ninety percent of the solvent remaining in the extracted oil simply evaporates and as it does it is collected for reuse ,Relevant
The rest is retrieved with the use of a stripping column ,Relevant
The oil is boiled by steam and the lighter hexane floats upward ,Relevant
As it condenses it too is collected ,Relevant
The oil is next refined to remove color odor and bitterness ,Relevant
Refining consists of heating the oil to between 107 and 188 degrees Fahrenheit 40 and 85 degrees Celsius and mixing an alkaline substance such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate with it ,Irrelevant
Soap forms from the undesired fatty acids and the alkaline additive and it is usually removed by centrifuge ,Relevant
The oil is further washed to remove traces of soap and then dried ,Relevant
Oils are also degummed at this time by treating them with water heated to between 188 and 206 degrees Fahrenheit 85 and 95 degrees Celsius steam or water with acid ,Relevant
The gums most of which are phosphatides precipitate out and the dregs are removed by centrifuge ,Relevant
Oil that will be heated for use in cooking is then bleached by filtering it through fuller s earth activated carbon or activated clays that absorb certain pigmented material from the oil ,Relevant
By contrast oil that will undergo refrigeration because it is intended for salad dressing for example is winterizedrapidly chilled and filtered to remove waxes ,Relevant
This procedure ensures that the oil will not partially solidify in the refrigerator ,Irrelevant
Finally the oil is deodorized ,Relevant
In this process steam is passed over hot oil in a vacuum at between 440 and 485 degrees Fahrenheit 225 and 250 degrees Celsius thus allowing the volatile taste and odor components to distill from the oil ,Relevant
Typically citric acid at 01 percent is also added to oil after deodorization to inactivate trace metals that might promote oxidation within the oil and hence shorten its shelf life ,Relevant
The completely processed oil is then IVmeasured and poured into clean containers usually plastic bottles for domestic oils to be sold in supermarkets glass bottles for imports or domestic oils to be sold in specialty stores or cans for imports usually olive oil ,Relevant
First tree trunks are stripped of bark and torn into small chips ,Relevant
Next these chips are placed in a large high pressure tank called a batch digester where they are cooked in a solution or liquor made of sodium hydroxide NaOH and several other ionic compounds such as sulfates sulfides and sulfites ,Relevant
These strongly alkaline chemicals dissolve the lignin the glue like substance that holds the individual wood fibers together in a tree trunk ,Relevant
When the pressure is released after several hours the wood chips explode like popcorn into fluffy masses of fiber ,Relevant
After additional cleaning and refining steps a consistent slurry of wood pulp is pumped to the paper making machine also known as a Fourdrinier machine ,Relevant
Gigantic square structures up to 600 feet long 182 88 meters these machines contain a wire mesh in which the paper is initially formed ,Relevant
Next the paper is fed into massive steam heated rollers and wide felt blankets that remove the water ,Relevant
At the end the finished medium or liner is rolled for shipment ,Relevant
Rolls of kraft paper for corrugating are available in many sizes to fit the production equipment at different corrugating plants ,Irrelevant
The most common roll sizes are 67 inches 170 18 centimeters wide and 87 inches 220 98 centimeters wide ,Irrelevant
An 87 inch roll of heavier paper can weigh up to 6 000 pounds 2 724 kilograms ,Irrelevant
As many as 22 rolls of 87 inch paper can be loaded into one railroad boxcar for shipment to a corrugating plant ,Irrelevant
At the plant the kraft paper is separated into different grades which will be used for the medium and the liner ,Relevant
These different grades of corrugated cardboard can be made by combining different grades of kraft paper ,Irrelevant
A knowledgeable packaging specialist works with a customer to determine the strength required for the corrugated cardboard container being planned ,Relevant
Then when a plant receives an order for containers a product engineer specifies the combination of medium and liner to produce a cardboard to match the customer s requirement ,Relevant
Using powerful fork lifts skilled equipment operators select move and load rolls of kraft paper at one end of the corrugator ,Relevant
Corrugated cardboard manufacture includes two key steps making kraft paper and corrugating the cardboard ,Relevant
Kraft paper involves pulping wood chips and then feeding the resulting paper substance through massive steam rollers that remove the water ,Relevant
Corrugating is also done in a machine that utilizes heavy rollers ,Relevant
One roll of cardboard is corrugated and then glued between two other layers liners by the same machine ,Relevant
The glue is then cured by passing the cardboard over heated rolls ,Relevant
One roll of medium is loaded to run through the corrugating rolls and a roll of liner is fed into the corrugator to be joined with the corrugated medium ,Relevant
Liner from another roll travels up over the corrugating rolls along a flat structure called the bridge ,Relevant
This liner will be glued to the corrugated medium later in the process ,Relevant
For a large production run additional rolls are loaded into automatic splicers ,Relevant
Sensitive detectors check the rolls of paper feeding into the corrugator ,Relevant
When a roll is nearly empty the corrugator control system starts a splicer and paper from the new roll is joined to the end of the paper going through the machine ,Relevant
Thus production of corrugated cardboard is continuous and no production speed is lost ,Irrelevant
The medium to be corrugated is fed into the giant electrically driven rollers of the corrugator first through the preheating rollers and then into the corrugating rolls ,Relevant
Steam at 175 to 180 pounds of pressure per square inch psi is forced through both sets of rollers and as the paper passes through them temperatures reach 350 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit 177 to 185 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
The corrugating rolls are covered with I O flutes horizontal parallel ridges like the teeth of massively wide gears ,Relevant
When the hot paper passes between the corrugating rolls the flutes trap and bend it forming the middle part of a sheet of corrugated cardboard ,Relevant
Each corrugating machine has interchangeable corrugating rolls featuring different flute sizes ,Irrelevant
Installing a different A finished piece of corrugated cardboard consists of a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liner layers ,Irrelevant
A finished piece of corrugated cardboard consists of a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liner layers flute size in the corrugator changes the width of the corrugated medium ,Irrelevant
The medium travels next to a set of rollers called the single facer glue station ,Relevant
Here one layer of liner is glued to the medium ,Relevant
Starch glue is carefully applied to the corrugated edges of the medium and the first layer of liner is added ,Relevant
From the single facer the medium and liner go to the double backer glue station where the other layer of liner from the bridge is added following the same procedure ,Relevant
Continuing through the corrugator the cardboard passes over steam heated plates that cure the glue ,Relevant
At the end of corrugator a slitter scorer trims the cardboard and cuts it into large sheets called box blanks ,Relevant
Box blanks pop out of the slitter scorer like wide slices of toast and slide into an automatic stacker that loads them onto a large rolling platform ,Relevant
From here they will be transported to the other machines that will convert them into finished containers ,Relevant
Skilled production workers use a computer terminal and printer to prepare a job ticket for each stack of box blanks produced by the corrugator ,Relevant
With the job ticket workers can route the stack to the right fabrication machines called flexos the name is short for flexographic machine ,Relevant
A flexo is a wide flat machine that processes box blanks ,Irrelevant
Printing dies and die cutting patterns I 3 are prepared in a pattern shop on large flexible sheets of rubber or tin ,Relevant
The dies and patterns are loaded onto the large rollers in the flexo and the box blanks are automatically fed through it ,Relevant
As each blank passes through the rollers of the flexo it is trimmed printed cut scored and in a printer folder gluer folded and glued to form a box ,Relevant
From the flexo the finished boxes are automatically stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped for shipping ,Relevant
Other equipment in a corrugating plant includes stand alone die cutters die cutters with print stations and machines known as curtain coaters that apply a wax coating to fruit vegetable and meat containers ,Relevant
Box blanks requiring only simple one color printing and die cutting can be run through a stand alone die cutter print station and curtain coater to produce water or grease resistant containers ,Relevant
Production begins with rectangular flat blanks of stainless steel sterling silver or in the case of plated flatware an alloy ,Relevant
Large rolls are stamped in individual blanks which are flat pieces roughly the same shape as the piece to be produced ,Relevant
Through a series of rolling operations these blanks are graded or rolled to the correct thickness and shapes required by the manufacturer s flatware patterns ,Relevant
First the blanks are rolled crosswise from left to right right to left and lengthwise then trimmed to outline ,Relevant
Each spoon for instance must be thick at the base of the handle to resist bending ,Relevant
This gives graded pieces the right balance and a good feel in the hand ,Irrelevant
Each piece is now in the form of a cleanly finished shape in the rough dimension of the utensil ,Irrelevant
Between operations the blanks must pass through annealing ovens to soften the metal for further machine operations ,Relevant
The annealing done under great heat must be very accurately controlled so the final piece will be resistant to bending and to nicks and dents when in use ,Relevant
The last annealing is the mostimportant because the pieces must be just the right degree of hardness when they are embossed ,Irrelevant
Then the metal can be forced easily into all the tiny details in the dies and the ornamentation will be faithfully reproduced ,Relevant
The rolled blanks are placed in the cutout press by an operator to remove the excess metal and to fashion the shape of the piece ,Relevant
This process is similar to cutting shapes from rolled dough ,Irrelevant
The shape of the piece is cut out of the metal and the excess metal is remelted and transformed back into sheets of metal to be used again ,Relevant
This trimming must ensure an accurate fit of the pieces into the dies when the design is applied ,Irrelevant
The next step is the forming of the pattern ,Relevant
Each pattern has its own hardened steel diestwo dies for each piece one with the pattern for the front of the piece and the other with the pattern for the back of the piece ,Irrelevant
These are carefully set in the hammers by die setters ,Relevant
The operator quickly places a piece in place under the drop hammer which descends with a hydraulic pressure of 200 tons ,Relevant
The bases of the drop hammers are bedded in 160 cubic yards of cement ,Irrelevant
The metal is squeezed into every tiny detail of the ornamentation in the die embossing the pattern on the piece ,Relevant
The blow of the hammer hardens the piece for use in the home ,Relevant
Surplus metal around the outline of the piece is then removed by clipping presses ,Relevant
Special steps are necessary for the creation of knives spoons forks and holloware pieces ,Irrelevant
To make the hollow handle for the knife after two strips of metal are formed to shape they are then soldered together buffed and polished until the seam is no longer visible ,Relevant
The blade and handle arepermanently joined by means of a powerful cement which bonds with great strength and durability ,Relevant
With the spoon after the pattern has been embossed upon the front and back of the handle the next step is the forming of the bowl ,Irrelevant
The forming is done again under the same powerful drop hammers from accurate steel dies ,Relevant
Each bowl requires two hammer blows ,Relevant
Surplus metal around the outline of the spoon is removed by clipping presses ,Relevant
A small burr still remains to be removed at a later operation ,Irrelevant
The forming of fork tines is a similar process to that of the forming of the spoon s bowl but the operation takes place before the pattern is applied to the handle ,Irrelevant
After a fork is cut to outline it is pierced and tined the tines are pieced out and the small piece of metal that holds the tip of the tines together is removed in another operation after the pattern has been applied ,Relevant
For the silver plated pieces the electroplating process is an additional step ,Relevant
The pieces are first prepared by being buffed so that the edges are smooth and the surfaces are free from small holes ,Relevant
When the buffing is completed the pieces are given a thorough cleaning with as many as 12 different chemical solutions ,Relevant
Finally they undergo electrolysis in which a layer of silver is electrically deposited over the base metal ,Relevant
The knives forks and spoons are now 10Jbuffed then polished ,Relevant
Depending on the pattern special finishing processes can give silver plated and sterling silver pieces a bright mirror like finish a soft satiny glow or a brushed or florentine finish ,Relevant
First styrene is made by combining ethylene and benzene ,Relevant
Next the styrene is subjected to suspension polymerization and treated with a polymerization initiator which together convert it into polystyrene ,Relevant
Once a polymer chain of the desired length has formed technicians stop the reaction with terminating agents ,Relevant
The resulting polystyrene beads are then cleaned and anomalous beads filtered out ,Relevant
To make small cell EPF workers then melt add a blowing agent to and extrude the beads ,Relevant
To produce smooth skinned EPF they pre expand the beads dramatically reducing their density ,Relevant
Next they heat and expand them before allowing them to sit for 24 hours so that they can cool and harden ,Relevant
The beads are then fed into a mold of the desired shape ,Relevant
The basic unit of polystyrene is styrene which is the product of a two fold reaction ,Irrelevant
Ethylene and benzene in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminum chloride form ethylbenzene C8H8which is then dehydrogenated hydrogen is removed at 1 112 1 202 degrees Fahrenheit 600 650 degrees Celsius to form styrene C8H8,Relevant
Polystyrene is formed from styrene through suspension polymerization a process by which tiny drops of the monomer in this case styrene are completely surrounded by water and a mucilaginous substance ,Relevant
Supporting and surrounding the styrene globules the suspension agent produces uniform droplets of polystyrene ,Relevant
Next a polymerization initiator is added to the droplets which are suspended by heat radiation of about 212 degrees Fahrenheit 100 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
This results in free radicals a group of atoms particularly likely to react with others because they contain unpaired electrons which are available for molecular bonding ,Irrelevant
Free radicals then combine at randomly to form chains of polystyrene ,Relevant
Stopping the polymerization process is difficult ,Irrelevant
Terminators are introduced to the process to end it at the appropriate time ,Relevant
Though variable chain length must fall within a certain range because polystyrene with overly long chains won t melt readily and polystyrene with short chains will be brittle ,Irrelevant
After polymerization is complete the mixtureconsisting of beads made up of polystyrene chainsis cooled ,Relevant
These beads are then washed out and dried ,Relevant
Uniform bead size is achieved by sorting the beads through meshes which filter out over and undersized beads ,Relevant
First the beads of polystyrene must be expanded to achieve the proper density ,Relevant
This process is known as pre expansion and involves heating the polystyrene either with steam the most common method or hot air for high density foam such as that used for a coffee cup the heating is carried out in a vessel holding anywhere from 50 to 500 gallons 189 to 1 892 liters ,Relevant
During pre expansion an agitator is used to keep the beads from fusing together ,Relevant
Since expanded beads are lighter than unexpanded beads they are forced to the top of the vessel s cavity and discharged ,Relevant
This process lowers the density of the beads to three percent of their original value and yields a smooth skinned closed cell EPF that is excellent for detailed molding ,Irrelevant
Next the pre expanded beads are usually aged for at least 24 hours in mesh storage silos ,Relevant
This allows air to diffuse into the beads cooling them and making them harder ,Irrelevant
After aging the beads are fed into a mold of the desired shape ,Relevant
Low pressure steam is then injected into and between the beads expanding them once more and fusing them together ,Relevant
The mold is then cooled either by circulating water through it or by spraying water on the outside ,Relevant
EPF is such a good insulator that it is hard to cool the mold down ,Irrelevant
Using small molds can reduce both the heating and cooling time and thereby speed up the process ,Irrelevant
This process yields EPF with small cell size that can be used to manufacture boards used for insulation ,Irrelevant
The beads are melted and a blowing agent is added ,Relevant
The molten polystyrene is then extruded into the proper shape under conditions of high temperature and pressure ,Relevant
EPF is usually cut with common wood I working tools which must be kept very sharp at all times to cut smoothly ,Relevant
It can also be bonded with adhesives that do not destroy it ,Relevant
Water based adhesives are good as are phenolics epoxies resorcinols and ureas ,Irrelevant
EPF is not resistant to weathering orsunlight and it is flammable so generally coatings such as epoxy different kinds of paint and nonflammable substances are applied to the surface ,Irrelevant
The following procedure assumes the plastic lenses are being made at an optical laboratory ,Irrelevant
The optical laboratory technician inputs the optical prescription for a pair of plastic lenses in the laboratory s computer ,Relevant
The computer then provides a printout specifying more information necessary for producing the required prescription ,Relevant
Based on this information the technician selects the appropriate plastic lens blanks ,Relevant
Each blank is placed in a prescription tray along with the customer s eyeglass frames and the original work order ,Relevant
The prescription tray will remain with the technician throughout the production process ,Irrelevant
The plastic blanks have different curves already ground into the front of them therefore the technician must select the blank that corresponds to the optical prescription required for each lens ,Relevant
The rest of the optical prescription or power must be ground into the back of the lens ,Relevant
The technician places the lenses in a lensometer an instrument used to locate and mark the optical center the point that should be centered over the customer s pupilof the lens blanks ,Relevant
Next adhesive tape is affixed to the front of each blank to keep the front from being scratched during the blocking process ,Relevant
The technician then places one lens blank at a time in a blocker machine which contains a heated lead alloy that fuses the block to the front of the blank ,Relevant
The blocks are used to hold each lens in place during the grinding and polishing processes ,Relevant
Next the technician places each blank into a generator a grinding machine that is set for the optical prescription ,Relevant
The generator grinds the appropriate optical curves into the back of each lens ,Relevant
After this step the lenses must be fined or polished ,Relevant
The technician selects a metal lenslapa mold corresponding to the required optical prescription of the lens and both lenses are placed in the fining machine with the back of each lens in the appropriate lap ,Relevant
The front of each lens is then polished in a series of fining operations ,Relevant
First each lens is rubbed against an abrasive fining pad made of softsandpaper ,Relevant
After a second fining pad made of a smooth plastic is placed over the original sandpaper pad the lens is polished again as the fining machine rotates the pads in a circular motion while water flows over the lenses ,Relevant
After the initial fining process is completed the two pads are peeled off and thrown away ,Relevant
Next the laps are removed from each lens and soaked in hot water for a few moments ,Relevant
The laps are then attached back on the lenses and placed in the fining machine where the third and final fining pad is attached ,Relevant
The fining machine rotates the pads in a circular motion while a polishing compound consisting of aluminum oxide water and polymers flows over the lenses ,Relevant
The lenses are removed from the fining machine and the block attached to each lens is gently detached with a small hammer ,Relevant
Then the tape is removed from each lens by hand ,Relevant
The laps are sterilized before they are used to hold other lenses ,Relevant
Each lens is marked L or R with a red greasepencil indicating which is the left and right lens ,Relevant
After the lenses are again placed in the lensometer to check and mark the optical center and inspect the other curves necessary for the proper optical prescription aleap pada small round metal holderis then affixed to the back of each lens ,Relevant
Next the technician selects the lens pattern that matches the shape of the eyeglass frames and inserts the pattern and the lenses into an edging machine ,Relevant
The machine grinds each lens to its proper shape and places a bevel around the edge of the lens so that the lens will fit the eyeglass frames ,Relevant
Water flows over the lens throughout this process ,Irrelevant
If the lenses require additional grinding the process is done by hand using a mounted power grinder ,Relevant
This step is necessary for lenses to be inserted in metal or rimless frames which require more precise bevels ,Irrelevant
Finally the lenses are dipped into the I desired treatment or tint container ,Relevant
After drying the eyeglass lenses are ready for insertion in the desired frames ,Relevant
The optical laboratory may send the lenses back to the optical outlet without the frames in which case the optical outlet will insert the lenses in the frames ,Relevant
The 18 gauge steel from which most components of a file cabinet are made is bought in large quantities ,Relevant
It can reach the factory in coils 11 8 to 15 7 inches 3 to 4 meter wide or for larger components such as the walls of the file cabinet in sheets of several sizes 9 8 by 12 feet or 8 by 9 8 feet 3 by 3 66 meters or 2 44 by 3 meters ,Irrelevant
To make small components such as compressors a ribbon of steel from a coil is rolled onto a machine that cuts it with a die ,Relevant
To make shelves or dividers the coils are unrolled and stamped in a press ,Relevant
To make the sides top and bottom of the file cabinet the large sheets of steel are cut to size ,Relevant
Stronger portions of the cabinets such as gussets ribs and end panels are made simply by folding the steel one two or three times depending on how much strength is desired and pounding it to form thick layered parts ,Relevant
Two assembly lines one for large parts and the other for small parts are set up for painting ,Relevant
To produce a superb finish conventionalor more often epoxy paints are used in an electrostatic gun ,Relevant
This effective method disperses the paint in powdered form yielding only one percent waste ,Relevant
Electrostatic painting works best in a vacuum so a 23 inch 58 centimeter area around the object to be painted is cleared ,Relevant
An aluminum wire runs from the paint gun to the cabinet in order to ground it ,Relevant
While the paint is given a positive charge the component to be painted receives a negative charge ,Relevant
The gun then sends the paint out through a small cupped head that rotates to cover all surfaces even those that are not flat evenly ,Relevant
After spraying the parts are heated to secure the paint ,Relevant
The strong bond that forms between the differently charged paint and part results in a durable finish ,Irrelevant
After being painted the top bottom and sides of the cabinet are welded together ,Relevant
The parts are held steady in a jig a device that resembles a vise ,Relevant
File cabinets are spot welded meaning that welds are made at regular intervals between two overlapping sheets of metal ,Relevant
During spot welding a low voltage high current power source with two electrodes one on each side of the joint is placed on a spot and pressure is applied ,Relevant
A current is generated between the two electrodes and the resistance of the metal to the current generates heat that bonds the two sheets together ,Relevant
This method is also known aselectrical resistance welding ,Irrelevant
The slide mechanisms on which the drawers move are usually purchased from a specialty manufacturer and placed within holders that are bolted in place within the cabinet ,Relevant
The drawers are then assembled ,Relevant
Some components such as the latch or the card label holder are merely slipped into pre cut holes in the steel and clamped into place ,Relevant
Other parts such as the handle are bolted into place ,Relevant
Manufacture of the tank type or cylinder fire extinguisher requires several manufacturing operations to form the pressure vessel load the chemical agent machine the valve and add the hardware hose or nozzle ,Irrelevant
Pressure vessels are formed from puck shaped disc blocks of special aluminum alloy ,Relevant
The puck is first impact extruded on a large press under great pressure ,Relevant
In impact extrusion the aluminum block is put into a die and rammed at very high velocity with a metal tool ,Relevant
This tremendous energy liquifies the aluminum and causes it to flow into a cavity around the tool ,Relevant
The aluminum thus takes the form of an open ended cylinder with considerably more volume than the original puck ,Irrelevant
The necking process puts a dome on the open end of the cylinder by constricting In a typical gas cartridge extinguisher a spike pierces the gas cartridge ,Relevant
The released gas expands quickly to fill the space above the water and pressurize the vessel ,Relevant
The water can then be pumped out of the extinguisher with the necessary force ,Relevant
In a typical gas cartridge extinguisher a spike pierces the gas cartridge ,Relevant
Thie open end with another operation called spinning ,Irrelevant
Spinning gently rolls the metal together increasing the wall thickness and reducing the diameter ,Relevant
After spinning the threads are added ,Relevant
The vessel is hydrostatically tested cleaned and coated with a powdered paint ,Relevant
The vessel is then baked in an oven where the paint is cured ,Relevant
Next the extinguishing agent is added ,Relevant
If the vessel is a stored pressure type the vessel is then pressurized accordingly ,Relevant
If a gas cartridge is necessary to help expel the extinguishing agent it is also inserted at this time ,Relevant
After the extinguishing element is added the vessel is sealed and the valve is added ,Relevant
The valve consists of a machined body made of metal bar stock on a lathe or a plastic injected molded part on the economy versions ,Irrelevant
It must be leak free and it must have provisions for threading into the cylinder ,Irrelevant
The final manufacturing operation is the assembly of the actuating handle safety pins and the mounting bracket ,Relevant
These parts are usually cold formedformed at low temperaturessteel or sheet metal forms purchased by the manufacturer from an outside vendor ,Irrelevant
Identification decals are also placed on the cylinder to identify the proper fire class rating as well as the suitability for recharging ,Relevant
Many of the economy versions are for one time use only and cannot be refilled ,Irrelevant
The manufacture of a floppy disk takes place in three phases ,Irrelevant
First the disk itself is made then the case is made and finally the two are assembled ,Relevant
The procedure for 8 and 5 1 4 inch disks differs slightly from that for the 3 1 2 inch model ,Irrelevant
First the recording media Mylar in the form of stock roll is coated with an extremely fine layer of iron oxide ,Relevant
The thickness of this layer depends on the size of the disk and the type of density ,Irrelevant
For instance the layer thickness is 110 microinches for 8 inch high density diskettes and 35 microinches for 3 1 2 inch high density disks ,Irrelevant
The coating for standard density diskettes is thicker than that for high density diskettes and is lesscoercive meaning that it has less magnetic force ,Irrelevant
Next the coated film is slit and appropriate size disks are punched out with an automatic device similar to a cookie cutter ,Relevant
Each disk is then burnished or polished according to the required specifications and standards 8 and 5 1 4 inch disks are now ready for insertion into jackets ,Relevant
For 3 1 2 inch disks a stainless steel hub is attached to the media with an adhesive ring 3 1 2 inch disks are now ready for insertion into their plastic cases ,Relevant
The jackets of the 8 inch and 5 1 4 inch disks are cut out of polyvinyl chloride PVC stock to appropriate size and the fabric liners laminated to them ,Relevant
Each jacket is then punched to appropriate hole and notch configuration ,Relevant
Thedrive spindle holein the middle helps to center the disk in the disk drive ,Relevant
Theindex hole when aligned with an index hole punched in the media permits the drive to locate the beginning of each segment of data ,Irrelevant
The long thin oval hole also called thehead access hole is used by the magnetic head to come in direct contact with the media ,Relevant
The write protect notch prevents data from mistakenly being recorded or erased ,Irrelevant
Therelief notcheskeep the lower end of the head access hole from bending ,Irrelevant
After the apertures have been punched the jacket is folded three ways with only the top flap left open ,Relevant
The jackets are now ready for assembly ,Irrelevant
The case or shell of 3 1 2 inch disks is molded out of hard plastic ,Relevant
It has a rectangular head access slot ,Irrelevant
The lower shell of the case is assembled with the button the wiper tab the write protect tab and the fabric liner ,Relevant
The upper shell is affixed with upper fabric liner ,Relevant
The spring loaded shutter assembly is now attached and the two shells are connected at the top two corners ,Relevant
The cases are now ready for assembly ,Irrelevant
For 8 and 5 1 4 inch disks the media is inserted into the jacket through the top ,Relevant
Each disk then undergoes comprehensiveelectrical and mechanical testing and certification ,Relevant
After the top of the jacket which had been left open is folded disk assembly is complete ,Relevant
Each disk is then given a final visual inspection before being labeled and packaged for shipment ,Relevant
Assembly of 3 1 2 inch disks is very similar ,Irrelevant
First the prepared media is inserted into the shell and then the disk is tested and certified ,Relevant
The two shells are now welded at the bottom two corners and the assembly is complete ,Relevant
Each disk is given a final visual inspection and then labeled and packaged for shipment ,Relevant
In lode or vein deposits the gold is mixed with another mineral often quartz in a vein that has filled a split in the surrounding rocks ,Relevant
Gold is obtained from lode deposits by drilling blasting or shoveling the surrounding rock ,Irrelevant
Lode deposits often run deep underground ,Irrelevant
To mine underground miners dig shafts into the ground along the vein ,Relevant
Using picks and small explosives they then remove the gold ore from the surrounding rock ,Relevant
The gold ore is then gathered up and taken to a mill for refinement ,Relevant
Placer deposits contain large pieces of gold ore nuggets and grains of gold that have been washed downstream from a lode deposit and that are usually mixed with sand or gravel ,Irrelevant
The three main methods used to mine placer deposits are hydraulic mining dredging and power shoveling ,Irrelevant
All methods of placer deposit mining use gravity as the basic sorting force ,Irrelevant
In the first method a machine called a hydraulic giant uses a high pressure stream of water to knock the gold ore off of banks containing the ore ,Relevant
The gold ore is then washed down into sluices or troughs that have grooves to catch the gold ,Relevant
Dredging and power shoveling involve the same techniques but work with different size buckets or shovels ,Irrelevant
In dredging buckets on a conveyor line scoop sand gravel and gold ore from the bottom of streams ,Irrelevant
In power shoveling huge machines act like shovels and scoop up large quantities of gold bearing sand and gravel from stream beds ,Irrelevant
Hydraulic mining and dredging are outlawed in many countries because they are environmentally destructive to both land and streams ,Irrelevant
Once the gold ore has been mined it usually is washed and filtered at the mine as a preliminary refinement technique ,Relevant
It is then shipped to mills where it is first combined with water and ground into smaller chunks ,Relevant
The resulting mixture is then further ground in a ball milla rotating cylindrical vessel that uses steel balls to pulverize the ore ,Relevant
The gold is then separated from the ore using one of several methods ,Relevant
Floatationinvolves the separation of gold from its ore by using certain chemicals and air ,Relevant
The finely ground ore is dumped into a solutionthat contains a frothing agent which causes the water to foam a collecting agent which bonds onto the gold forming an oily film that sticks to air bubbles and a mixture of organic chemicals which keep the other contaminants from also bonding to the air bubbles ,Relevant
The solution is then aeratedair bubbles are blown inand the gold attaches to the air bubbles ,Relevant
The bubbles float to the top and the gold is skimmed off ,Relevant
Cyanidationalso involves using chemicals to separate the gold from its contaminants ,Relevant
In this process the ground ore is placed in a tank containing a weak solution of cyanide ,Relevant
Next zinc is added to the tank causing a chemical reaction in which the end result is the precipitation separation of the gold from its ore ,Relevant
The gold precipitate is then separated from the cyanide solution in a filter press ,Relevant
A similar method isamalgamation which uses the same process with different chemicals ,Irrelevant
First a solution carries the ground ore over plates covered with mercury ,Relevant
The mercury attracts the gold forming an alloy called anamalgam ,Relevant
The amalgam is then heated causing the mercury to boil off as a gas and leaving behind the gold ,Relevant
The mercury is collected recycled and used again in the same process ,Relevant
Thecarbon in pulpmethod also uses cyanide but utilizes carbon instead of zinc to precipitate the gold ,Irrelevant
The first step is to mix the ground ore with water to form a pulp ,Relevant
Next cyanide is added to dissolve the gold and then carbon is added to bond with the gold ,Relevant
After the carbon particles are removed from the pulp they are placed in a hot caustic corrosive carbon solution which separates the gold from the carbon ,Relevant
If the gold is still not pure enough it can be smelted ,Irrelevant
Smeltinginvolves heating the gold with a chemical substance calledflux ,Relevant
The flux bonds with the contaminants and floats on top of the melted gold ,Irrelevant
The gold is then cooled and allowed to harden in molds and the flux contaminant mixtureslag is hauled away as a solid waste ,Relevant
The floor and body panels are made of sheet steel aluminum or fiber glass ,Irrelevant
If sheet metal is used the metal is cut to size in a sheet metal shear a machine that cuts it with giant scissors ,Relevant
It is then fed into a roll forming machine which shapes the metal by passing it over contoured forming rolls ,Relevant
If fiber glass is the chosen material the floor and body panels are formed as one piece by inserting layers of resin coated fiber glass in a mold and allowing them to harden ,Relevant
Tubular steel which resembles square bicycle handlebars is cut to size and the edges beveled cut at an angle of less than 90 degrees to prepare them for welding ,Relevant
The cut beveled pieces are then placed in a welding fixture and the chassis or frame is arc welded ,Relevant
In this process an electric current is fed out of the welding torch through a metal wire that is shielded by a concurrently emitted inert gas usually argon or helium ,Relevant
As the wire melts it joins the tubes to form the chassis ,Relevant
Next the floor is welded in place and the attaching hardware for the suspension motor and body are arc welded to the frame ,Relevant
At this point the chassis may need to be straightened to adjust for stresses introduced into the steel tubing during welding ,Relevant
Once it is straight the chassis and body panels are cleaned and painted with a rust preventive finish coating ,Relevant
Next the right and left side of the transaxle housing are fitted with bearings gears seals and axle housings ,Relevant
Because of the close fits required for the bearings and gears these parts must be manually installed with special assembly tools ,Relevant
For example a special gauge is used to determine the size of the spacer required under the pinion gear ,Irrelevant
These spacers are used to setpreloadpressure between the gear faces andbacklashspacing between the gear faces ,Relevant
Next the two mating surfaces of the transaxle housing are coated with an anaerobic sealant which hardens in the absence of air and bolted together ,Relevant
The axle shafts and bearings are then slid into the axle housings and locked in place ,Relevant
The transaxle access plate and gasket are positioned and bolted in place ,Relevant
Auto adjusting drum type mechanical brakes are then assembled to each end of the axle housings ,Relevant
The rear cover is snapped into the base plate ,Relevant
The transformer which adjusts the direct current provided by the battery into an alternating current that is easier for the motor to use is then bolted to the base plate ,Relevant
Next the electric cable with plug thermal switch and DC Ammeter used to measure the battery s direct current output are wired in and attached ,Relevant
Finally the wrap around and face cover are bolted in place ,Relevant
The transaxle subassembly and the welded chassis are placed on a stand that is just the right height to allow the assembly personal to work in a upright position with a minimum of bending ,Relevant
The shock absorbersoil filled cylinders that cushion the ride by displacing the oil when a bump is hitare the first components bolted to the chassis one at each wheel location ,Relevant
Next the springs are bolted to the chassis with multiple leaf springs at the front axles and coil springs at the rear ,Relevant
The transaxle and the chassis are joined together by pinning the shock absorbers to the transaxle ,Relevant
Prior to assembly the coil springs must be compressed using a special fixture ,Relevant
The front axle bar may now be attached to the chassis by bolting the multiple leaf springs to the front axle bar from the chassis ,Relevant
The front axle shafts are then bolted to each end of the front axle bar ,Relevant
To insure smooth movement the wheel bearings are packed meaning that grease is forced into the bearing until it comes out the other side ,Relevant
The wheel plate with studs is then installed ,Relevant
The rack and pinion steering assembly is now bolted to the chassis and attached to the front axle shafts ,Relevant
The steering wheel and steering wheel shaft are then attached to the chassis and rack and pinion steering assembly ,Relevant
Next the body panels are bolted to the chassis and then the motor is installed ,Relevant
If the cart is to be electric powered a 36 volt direct current electric motor is bolted to the transaxle ,Relevant
If the cart is to be gasoline powered an eight horsepower gasoline engine is bolted to the chassis ,Relevant
The continuously variable CV transmission is also bolted to the chassis ,Relevant
Belts are then installed to the drive pulleys of the engine CV transmission and transaxle ,Relevant
The brake pedal is installed ,Relevant
Brake cables are routed and attached to the pedal and rear brakes ,Relevant
The accelerator pedal is installed and the accelerator cable is attached to the pedal and the engine ,Relevant
Next the electrical cables are routed and attached to the chassis ,Relevant
The headlights stoplights and on off key lock are installed and cables connected ,Relevant
Next the battery rack is bolted in and the batteries installed six six volt batteries for the electric drive vehicle or one twelve volt battery for the gasoline engine vehicle ,Relevant
A six gallon fuel tank is then installed in the gasoline engine vehicle and a hose routed from the tank to the engine ,Relevant
The batteries are connected and the fuel tank filled ,Relevant
The seat cushions are installed and if ordered the canopy top windshield and storage baskets are attached ,Relevant
For delivery in North America there are no packaging requirements ,Irrelevant
Delivery is normally by truck ,Irrelevant
After being driven onto the truck the golf carts have their fuel drained their batteries disconnected and their wheels blocked in place ,Relevant
Overseas shipments require that the golf cart be placed on a skida heavy wood or steel rackto discourage shifting in transit ,Relevant
Most grinding wheels are manufactured by the cold press method in which a mixture of components is pressed into shape at room temperature,Relevant
The details of processes vary considerably depending upon the type of wheel and the practices of individual companies,Irrelevant
For mass production of small wheels many portions of the process are automated,Irrelevant
Preparing the grinding wheel mixture begins with selecting precise quantities of abrasives bond materials and additives according to a specific formula,Relevant
A binder typically a water based wetting agent in the case of vitrified wheels is added to coat the abrasive grains this coating improves the grains adhesion to the binder,Relevant
The binder also helps the grinding wheel retain its shape until the bond is solidified,Irrelevant
Some manufacturers simply mix all materials in a single mixer,Relevant
Others use separate steps to mix abrasive grains with binder,Relevant
Wheel manufacturers often spend considerable effort to develop a satisfactory mixture,Irrelevant
The blend must be free flowing and distribute grain evenly throughout the structure of the grinding wheel to assure uniform cutting action and minimal vibration as the wheel rotates during use,Irrelevant
This is particularly important for large wheels which may be as big as several feet in diameter or for wheels that have a shape other than the familiar flat disk,Irrelevant
For the most common type of wheel an annular disc a predetermined amount of grinding wheel mixture is poured into a mold consisting of four pieces a circular pin the size of the finished wheel s arbor hole its center hole a shell with a 1 inch 2 5 centimeter wall about twice as high as the desired grinding wheel is thick and two flat circular plates with diameter and arbor hole sizes equal to those of the wheel,Relevant
A variety of methods are used to distribute the mixture evenly,Irrelevant
Typically a straight edge pivots about the center arbor pin to spread the mixture throughout the mold,Relevant
Using pressures in the range of 100 to 5000 pounds per square inch psi for 10 to 30 seconds a hydraulic press then compacts the mixture into the grinding wheel s final shape,Relevant
Some manufacturers use gage blocks between the two face plates to limit their movement and establish uniform thickness,Relevant
Others control wheel thickness by closely monitoring the consistency of the mix and the force of the press,Relevant
After the mold has been removed from the press and the wheel stripped from the mold the wheel is placed on a flat heatproof carrier,Relevant
Final shaping of the wheel may take place at this time,Relevant
All work at this stage has to be done very carefully because the wheel is held together by only the temporary binder,Irrelevant
Lighter wheels can be lifted by hand at this stage heavier ones may be lifted with a hoist or carefully slid on a carrier to be transported to the kiln,Relevant
Generally the purposes of the firing are to melt the binder around the abrasives and to convert it to a form that will resist the heat and solvents encountered during grinding,Irrelevant
A wide range of furnaces and kilns are used to fire grinding wheels and the temperatures vary widely depending upon the type of bond,Irrelevant
Wheels with a resin bond are typically fired at a temperature of 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit 149 to 204 degrees Celsius and wheels with vitrified bonds are fired to temperatures between 1700 and 2300 degrees Fahrenheit 927 to 1260 degrees Celsius ,Irrelevant
After firing wheels are moved to a finishing area where arbor holes are reamed or cast to the specified size and the wheel circumference is made concentric with the center,Relevant
Steps may be necessary to correct thickness or parallelism of wheel sides or to create special contours on the side or circumference of the wheel,Relevant
Manufacturers also balance large wheels to reduce the vibration that will be generated when the wheel is spun on a grinding machine,Relevant
Once wheels have received labels and other markings they are ready for shipment to the consumer,Relevant
The first and most important step in guitar construction is wood selection,Relevant
The choice of wood will directly affect the sound quality of the finished product,Irrelevant
The wood must be free of flaws and have a straight vertical grain,Irrelevant
Since each section of the guitar uses different types of woods the construction process varies from section to section,Irrelevant
Following is a description of the manufacture of a typical acoustic guitar,Irrelevant
The wood for the top of the guitar is cut from lumber using a process called bookmatching,Relevant
Bookmatching is a method by which a single piece of wood is sliced into two sheets each the same length and width as the original but only half as thick,Relevant
This gives the sheets a symmetrical grain pattern,Irrelevant
The two sheets are matched to ensure continuity in the grains and glued together,Relevant
Once dry the newly joined boards are sanded to the proper thickness,Relevant
They are closely inspected for quality and then graded according to color closeness and regularity of grain and lack of blemishes,Relevant
The next step is to cut the top into the guitar shape leaving the piece of wood oversized until the final trimming,Relevant
The soundhole is sawed with slots carved around it for concentric circles that serve as decorative inlays around the soundhole,Relevant
Wood braces are next glued to the underside of the top piece,Relevant
Strutting as this process is often called serves two purposes brace the wood against the pull of the strings and control the way the top vibrates,Irrelevant
An area of guitar construction that differs from company to company strutting has a great affect on the guitar s tone,Irrelevant
Many braces today are glued in an X pattern originally designed by the Martin Company a pattern that most experts feel provides the truest acoustics and tone,Irrelevant
Although companies such as Ovation and Gibson continue to experiment with improvements on the X pattern style of strutting Martin s original concept is widely accepted as producing the best sound,Irrelevant
The back although not as acoustically important as the top is still critical to the guitar s sound,Irrelevant
A reflector of sound waves the back is also braced but its strips of wood run parallel from left to right with one cross grained strip running down the length of the back s glue joint,Relevant
The back is cut and glued similar to the topand from the same piece of lumber as the top to ensure matching grainsusing the bookinatch technique,Relevant
Construction of the sides consists of cutting and sanding the strips of wood to the proper length and thickness and then softening the wood in water,Relevant
The strips are then placed in molds that are shaped to the curves of the guitar and the entire assembly is clamped for a period of time to ensure symmetry between the two sides,Relevant
The two sides are joined together with basswood glued to the inside walls,Relevant
Strips of reinforcing wood are placed along the inner sides so that the guitar doesn t crack if hit from the side,Relevant
Two endblocks near the neck and near the bottom of the guitar are also used to join the top back and neck,Relevant
Once the sides are joined and the end blocks are in place the top and the back are glued to the sides,Relevant
The excess wood is trimmed off and slots are cut along the side top and side back junctions,Relevant
These slots are for the body bindings that cover the guitar s sides,Irrelevant
The bindings are not only decorative they also keep moisture from entering through the sides and warping the guitar,Irrelevant
The neck is made from one piece of hard wood typically mahogany or rosewood carved to exact specifications,Irrelevant
A reinforcing rod is inserted through the length of the neck and after sanding the fingerboard often made of ebony or rosewood is set in place,Relevant
Using precise measurements fret slots are cut into the fingerboard and the steel wired frets are put in place,Relevant
Once the neck construction is completed it is attached to the body,Relevant
Most guitar companies attach the neck and the body by fitting a heel that extends from the base of the neck into a pre cut groove on the body,Relevant
Once the glue has dried at the neck body junction the entire guitar receives a coat of sealer and then several coats of lacquer,Relevant
On some models intricate decorations or inlays are also placed on the guitar top,Relevant
After polishing a bridge is attached near the bottom of the guitar below the sound hole and a saddle is fitted,Relevant
The saddle is where the strings actually lie as they pass over the bridge and it is extremely important in the transferring of string vibration to the guitar top,Irrelevant
On the opposite end of the guitar the nut is placed between the neck and the head,Relevant
The nut is a strip of wood or plastic on which the strings lie as they pass to the head and into the tuning machine,Irrelevant
The tuning machine is next fitted to the guitar head,Relevant
This machine is one of the most delicate parts of the guitar and is usually mounted on the back of the head,Irrelevant
The pegs that hold each string poke through to the front and the gears that turn both the pegs and the string tightening keys are housed in metal casings,Relevant
Finally the guitar is strung and inspected before leaving the factory,Relevant
The entire process of making a guitar can take between three weeks and two months depending on the amount of decorative detail work on the guitar top,Irrelevant
Each individual tubular part is cut by a tube cutting machine that can be quickly set to produce different precise lengths and specified batch quantities,Relevant
Tubing requiring angular bends is shaped to the proper angle in a bending machine that utilizes interchangeable tools for different diameters and sizes,Relevant
For other than minor bends tubes are filled with molten sodium silicate that hardens and eliminates kinking by causing the tube to bend as a solid bar,Irrelevant
The so calledwater glassis then removed by placing thebent tube in boiling water which melts the inner material,Relevant
Tubing that must be curved to match fuselage contours is fitted over a stretch forming machine which stretches the metal to a precisely contoured shape,Relevant
Next the tubular details are delivered to the machine shop where they are held in clamps so that their ends can be machined to the required angle and shape,Relevant
The tubes are then deburred a process in which any ridges or fins that remain after preliminary machining are ground off and inspected for cracks,Relevant
Gussets reinforcing plates or brackets and other reinforcing details of metal are machined from plate angle or extruded profile stock by routing shearing blanking or sawing,Relevant
Some critical or complex details may be forged or investment cast,Relevant
The latter process entails injecting wax or an alloy with a low melting point into a mold or die,Relevant
When the template has been formed it is dipped in molten metal as many times as necessary to achieve the thickness desired,Relevant
When the part has dried it is heated so that the wax or alloy will melt and can be poured out,Relevant
Heated to a higher temperature to purify it and placed in a mold box where it is supported by sand the mold is then ready to shape molten metal into reinforcement parts,Relevant
After removal and cooling these parts are then finish machined by standard methods before being deburred once again,Relevant
The tubes are chemically cleaned fitted into a subassembly fixture and MIG metal arc inert gas welded,Relevant
In this process a small electrode wire is fed through a welding torch and an inert shielding gas usually argon or helium is passed through a nozzle around it the tubes are joined by the melting of the wire,Relevant
After welding the subassembly is stress relievedheated to a low temperature so that the metal can recover any elasticity it has lost during the shaping process,Relevant
Finally the welds are inspected for flaws,Relevant
Sheet metal which makes up other parts of the airframe is first cut into blanks pieces cut to predetermined size in preparation for subsequent work by abrasive water jet blanking dies or routing,Relevant
Aluminum blanks are heat treated to anneal them give them a uniform strain free structure that will increase their malleability ,Relevant
The blanks are then refrigerated until they are placed in dies where they will be pressed into the proper shape,Relevant
After forming the sheet metal details are aged to full strength and trimmed by routing to final shape and size,Relevant
Sheet metal parts are cleaned before being assembled by riveting or adhesive bonding,Relevant
Aluminum parts and welded subassemblies may be anodized treated to thicken the protective oxide film on the surface of the aluminum which increases corrosion resistance,Relevant
All metal parts are chemically cleaned and primer painted and most receive finishpaintby spraying with epoxy or other durable coating,Relevant
Cores the central parts of the composite components are made of Nomex a brand of aramid produced by Du Pont or aluminum honeycomb which is cut to size by bandsaw or reciprocating knife,Irrelevant
If necessary the cores then have their edges trimmed and beveled by a machine tool similar to a pizza cutter or meat slicing blade,Relevant
The material with which each component is built up from its cores each component may use multiple cores is calledpre preg ply,Irrelevant
The plies are layers of oriented fibers usually epoxy or polyimide that have been impregnated with resin,Irrelevant
Following written instructions from the designers workers create highly contoured skin panels by setting individual plies on bond mold tools and sandwiching cores between additional plies as directed,Relevant
Completedlayups as the layers of prepreg affixed to the mold are called are then transported to an autoclave for curing,Relevant
An autoclave is a machine that laminates plastics by exposing them to pressurized steam and curing is the hardening that occurs as the resin layers cook in the autoclave,Irrelevant
Visible trim lines are molded into the panels by scribe lines present in the bond mold tools,Relevant
Excess material around the edges is then removed by bandsawing,Relevant
Large panels may be trimmed by an abrasive water jet manipulated by a robot,Relevant
After inspection trimmed panels and other composite details are cleaned and painted by normal spray methods,Relevant
Surfaces must be well sealed by paint to prevent metal corrosion or water absorption,Relevant
Canopies or windscreens and passenger compartment windows are generally made of polycarbonate sheet,Irrelevant
Front panelssubject to bird strike or other impact may be laminated of two sheets for greater thickness,Irrelevant
All such parts are made by placing an oversized blank on a fixture heating it and then forming it to the required curvature by use of air pressure in a freeblowing process,Relevant
In this method no tool surface touches the optical surfaces to cause defects,Irrelevant
Modern helicopter engines are turbine rather than piston type and are purchased from an engine supplier,Irrelevant
The helicopter manufacturer may purchase or produce the transmission assembly which transfers power to the rotor assembly,Irrelevant
Transmission cases are made of aluminum or magnesium alloy,Irrelevant
As with the above the main and tail rotor assemblies are machined from specially selected high strength metals but are produced by typical machine shop methods,Irrelevant
The rotor blades themselves are machined from composite layup shapes,Irrelevant
Main rotor blades may have a sheet metal layer adhesively bonded to protect the leading edges,Irrelevant
Wiring harnesses are produced by laying out the required wires on special boards that serve as templates to define the length and path to connectors,Irrelevant
Looms or knitted protective covers are placed on the wire bundles and the purchased connectors are soldered in place by hand,Relevant
Hydraulic tubing is either hand cut to length and hand formed by craftsmen or measured formned and cut by tube bending machines,Relevant
Ends are flared and tubes are inspected for dimensional accuracy and to ensure that no cracks are present,Relevant
Hydraulic pumps and actuators instrumentation and electrical devices are typically purchased to specification rather than produced by the helicopter manufacturer,Irrelevant
Finished and inspected detail airframe parts including sheet metal tubular and machined and welded items are delivered to subassembly jigs fixtures that clamp parts being assembled ,Relevant
Central parts are located in each jig and associated details are either bolted in place or where rivets are to be used match drilled using pneumatically powered drills to drill and ream each rivet hole,Relevant
For aerodynamic smoothness on sheet metal or composite skin panels holes are countersunk so that the heads of flat headed screws won t protrude,Relevant
All holes are deburred and rivets applied,Relevant
A sealant is often applied in each rivet hole as the rivet is inserted,Relevant
For some situations semi automated machines may be used for moving from one hole location to the next drilling reaming sealing and installing the rivets under operator control,Irrelevant
After each subassembly is accepted by an inspector it typically moves to another jig to be further combined with other small subassemblies and details such as brackets,Irrelevant
Inspected top level subassemblies are then delivered to final assembly jigs where the overall helicopter structure is integrated,Relevant
Upon completion of the structure the propulsion components are added and wiring and hydraulics are installed and tested,Relevant
Canopy windows doors instruments and interior elements are then added to complete the vehicle,Relevant
Finish painting and trimming are completed at appropriate points during this process,Relevant
After all systems are inspected in final form along with physical assemblies and appearance aspects the complete documentation of materials processes inspection and rework effort for each vehicle is checked and filed for reference,Relevant
The helicopter propulsion system is tested and the aircraft is flight tested,Relevant
Building and assembling the components of a jet engine takes about two years after a design and testing period that can take up to five years for each model,Irrelevant
The research and development phase is so protracted because the engines are so complex a standard Boeing 747 engine for example contains almost 25 000 parts,Irrelevant
In jet engine manufacture the various parts are made individually as part of subassemblies the subassemblies then come together to form the whole engine,Irrelevant
One such part is the fan blade situated at the front of the engine,Irrelevant
Each fan blade consists of two blade skins produced by shaping molten titanium in a hot press,Irrelevant
When removed each blade skin is welded to a mate with a hollow cavity in the center,Irrelevant
To increase the strength of the final product this cavity is filled with a titanium honeycomb,Irrelevant
The disc the solid core to which the blades of the compressor are attached resembles a big notched wheel,Irrelevant
It must be extremely strong and free of even minute imperfections as these could easily develop into fractures under the tremendous stress of engine operation,Irrelevant
For a long time the most popular way to manufacture the disc entailed machine cutting a metal blank into a rough approximation of the desired shape then heating and stamping it to precise specifications in addition to rendering the metal malleable heat also helps to fuse hairline cracks ,Irrelevant
Today however a more sophisticated method of producing discs is being used by more and more manufacturers,Irrelevant
Calledpowder metallurgy it consists of pouring molten metal onto a rapidly rotating turntable that breaks the metal into millions of microscopic droplets that are flung back up almost immediatelydue to the table s spinning,Relevant
As they leave the table the droplets temperature suddenly plummets by roughly 2 120 degrees Fahrenheit1 000 degrees Celsiusin half a second causing them to solidify and form a fine grained metal powder,Relevant
The resulting powder is very pure because it solidifies too quickly to pick up contaminants,Irrelevant
In the next step the powder is packed into a forming case and put into a vacuum,Relevant
Vibrated the powder sifts down until it is tightly packed at the bottom of the case the vacuum guarantees that no air pockets develop,Relevant
The case is then sealed and heated under high pressure about 25 000 pounds per square inch ,Relevant
This combination of heat and pressure fuses the metal particles into a disc,Relevant
The disc is then shaped on a large cutting machine and bolted to the fan blades,Relevant
Casting an extremely old method is still used to form the compressor blades,Irrelevant
In this process the alloy from which the blades will be formed is poured into a ceramic mold heated in a furnace and cooled,Relevant
When the mold is broken off the blades are machined to their final shape,Relevant
Combustion chambers must blend air and fuel in a small space and work for prolonged periods in extreme heat,Relevant
To accomplish this titanium is alloyed to increase its ductilityits ability to formed into shapes,Relevant
It is then heated before being poured into several discrete and very complex segment molds,Relevant
The sections are removed from theirmolds allowed to cool and welded together before being mounted on the engine,Relevant
The turbine disc is formed by the same powder metallurgy process used to create the compressor disc,Irrelevant
Turbine blades however are made by a somewhat different method than that used to form compressor blades because they are subjected to even greater stress due to the intense heat of the combustor that lies just in front of them,Irrelevant
First copies of the blades are formed by pouring wax into metal molds,Relevant
Once each wax shape has set it is removed from the mold and immersed in a ceramic slurry bath forming a ceramic coating about 25 inch 63 centimeter thick,Relevant
Each cluster is then heated to harden the ceramic and melt the wax,Relevant
Molten metal is now poured into the hollow left by the melted wax,Relevant
The internal air cooling passages within each blade are also formed during this stage of production,Relevant
The metal grains in the blade are now aligned parallel to the blade by a process calleddirectional solidifying,Relevant
The grain direction is important because the turbine blades are subjected to so much stress if the grains are aligned correctly the blade is much less likely to fracture,Irrelevant
The solidifying process takes place in computer controlled ovens in which the blades are carefully heated according to precise specifications,Irrelevant
The metal grains assume the correct configuration as they cool following their removal from the ovens,Irrelevant
The next and final stages in preparing turbine blades are machine shaping and either laser drilling or spark erosion,Irrelevant
First the blade is honed to the final desired shape through a machining process,Relevant
Next parallel lines of tiny holes are formed in each blade as a supplement to the interior cooling passageways,Relevant
The holes are formed by either a small laser beam or by spark erosion in which carefully controlled sparks are permitted to eat holes in the blade,Relevant
The inner duct and the afterburners of the exhaust system are molded from titanium while the outer duct and the nacelle the engine casing are formed from Kevlar,Relevant
After these three components have been welded into a subassembly the entire engine is ready to be put together,Relevant
Engines are constructed by manually combining the various subassemblies and accessories,Relevant
An engine is typically built in a vertical position from the aft end forward on a fixture that will allow the operator to manipulate the engine easily during build up,Irrelevant
Assembly begins with bolting the high pressure turbine that closest to the combustor to the low pressure turbine that furthest from the cumbustor ,Relevant
Next the combustion chamber is fastened to the turbines,Relevant
One process that is used to build a balanced turbine assembly utilizes a CNC Computer Numerically Controlled robot capable of selecting analyzing and joining a turbine blade to its hub,Relevant
This robot can determine the weight of a blade and place it appropriately for a balanced assembly,Irrelevant
Once the turbines and combustion chamber have been assembled the high and low pressure compressors are attached,Relevant
The fan and its frame comprise the forward most subassembly and they are connected next,Relevant
The main drive shaft connecting the low pressure turbine to the low pressure compressor and fan is then installed thus completing the engine core,Relevant
After the final subassembly the exhaust system has been attached the engine is ready to be shipped to the aircraft manufacturer where the plumbing wiring accessories and aerodynamic shell of the plane will be integrated,Relevant
First 48 inch by 112 inch 122 centimeter by 284 centimeter sheets of metal are cut into small square pieces with a flat shear that resembles a very large table top paper cutter,Relevant
A CNC Turret Press is a machine programmed with the dimensions of the sheet metal to be perforated and the location of each hole and notch the shapes and sizes of each hole and notch also are entered,Irrelevant
The machine has a magazine of punches in varying sizes and pre determined locations in a turret rotary holder,Irrelevant
An operator places a sheet on the machine bed table positions it against three fixed points to insure squareness and clamps it to the table,Relevant
The machine will then move the sheet steel over a bed of rollers to different positions under the turret before rotating the turret to the punch programmed for that specific location and triggering the press to punch a hole,Relevant
Machines of this design can house upwards of 60 different punch geometries and move and strike the sheet metal at high speeds,Irrelevant
Most sheet metal cabinetry manufacturers use this technology extensively,Irrelevant
Neither computer programmed nor automated conventional punch presses performhard tooling in other words they punch only a particular shape and size hole,Irrelevant
Sheet metal is placed into a die by an operator,Relevant
As the press moves downward the sheet metal is punched,Relevant
These machines cost less than CNC Presses but the sheet metal must be placed in numerous presses to obtain the desired configuration of punches,Irrelevant
After the sheet metal has been sheared and perforated some pieces need to be bent in machines known aspower press brakesorbrakesfor short,Relevant
Brakes can range in length from 4 to 20 feet 1 2 to 6 1 meters but they are typically about 10 feet 3 meters long,Irrelevant
Both the stationary bottom orbed and the moving upper orram have slots that run the length of the machine,Irrelevant
Because these slots are aligned any tool placed into them will always be perfectly aligned,Irrelevant
The bed has a rectangular block with an open V on its topside while the ram has a knife edged blade with a radius at its cutting edge,Irrelevant
The ram s descent into the open bottom V is controlled the depth at which the blade enters the bed controls the angle at which the sheet metal is bent,Relevant
A simple straight edge serves as a back gauge,Irrelevant
Next the components of both chamber and case are fitted together some with sheet metal screws,Relevant
Others are joined by means of spot welding a process in which separate pieces of material are fused with pressure and heat,Relevant
Other components are arc welded using one of three methods,Relevant
In the first method known as MIG metal arc inert gas welding a coil of thin wire is threaded through a hand held gun,Relevant
A hose is connected from a tank of inert gas usually argon to the tip of the gun s nozzle,Relevant
A machine generating electrical current is attached to the wire in the gun and the work piece,Relevant
When the gun s trigger is pulled the wire rod moves feeding toward the work piece and the gas is released creating an atmosphere at the point where the wire arcs with the metal,Relevant
This allows the joining of the parts,Relevant
The second arc welding method is known as stick welding,Irrelevant
In this process a thin rod approximately 12 inches long 187 inch thick 30 centimeters long 47 centimeter thick and coated with a flux material is placed into a hand held holder,Relevant
This holder is attached to a machine generating an electrical charge,Irrelevant
Also connected to the machine is a grounding cable that has an end clamped to the part to be welded,Irrelevant
When the rod is close to the parts an arc is struck generating intense heat that melts the rod and flux,Relevant
The flux acts as a cleanser allowing the rod material to adhere to both pieces of metal,Irrelevant
The welder drags the rod along the seams of the metal while maintaining its distance from the seam to allow the arc to remain constant,Irrelevant
The third arc welding method used to assemble the incubator is TIG tungsten arc inert gas welding a combination of stick and MIG welding,Irrelevant
In this process a stationary tungsten rod without any flux is inserted into a hand held gun,Relevant
Inert gas flows from a tank through the gun s nozzle,Relevant
When the trigger is pulled the gas creates an atmosphere as the tungsten rod strikes its arc the two parts fuse together without any filler metal,Relevant
At this point the case may be painted to further provide surface protection both inside and outside the inner chamber is never painted ,Relevant
The box is spray painted usually with an electrostatically charged powderpaint,Relevant
This process requires that a small electrical charge be applied so that it will attract the powder particles which have been given an opposite charge,Irrelevant
After the case is sprayed it is moved into an oven that melts the powder particles causing them to adhere to the freshly cleaned metal surface,Relevant
This process is very clean efficient and environmentally friendly and the high quality paint resists most laboratory spills,Irrelevant
Next the inner chamber is wrapped with insulation either blanket batting or hard board placed inside the case and secured,Relevant
If the unit is water jacketed thejacket is placed inside the case and the chamber inside the jacket,Irrelevant
A sheet metal door is constructed using methods similar to that mentioned above,Relevant
While the sheet metal cabinetry is being fabricated a control panel is being assembled elsewhere in the factory,Relevant
Following detailed electrical prints electricians fasten different colored wire of varying thicknesses to electrical devices,Relevant
The color scheme helps technicians to diagnose problems quickly and the various thicknesses allow for safe and efficient transfer of lower and higher voltages,Relevant
Purchased electrical devices such as fuse blocks switches terminal blocks and relays adhere to strict electrical codes,Irrelevant
Finally the wires from the control panel are attached to the control devices on off switches or micro processors and the electro mechanical devices fan motor lights and heaters ,Relevant
The incubator now has its inner glass and the outer solid door attached and shelving and supplemental features are installed,Relevant
Each unit is 100 percent functionally tested,Irrelevant
The parameters for each test are set to verify the unit s performance against advertised specifications or the customer s requests whichever is more stringent,Irrelevant
Problems are corrected and the equipment is retested,Relevant
A copy of the test result is kept on file and the original sent to the customer,Relevant
The incubator receives a thorough cleaning inside and out,Relevant
Shelves are removed and packaged separately and the doors are taped closed,Relevant
A brace is positioned under the door to help prevent sagging,Relevant
Next each unit is secured to a wooden skid and acorrugated cardboardbox is placed around the case,Relevant
Packing filler is put in between the carton and the case,Relevant
Finally the product is shipped,Relevant
The steel or aluminum body is die cast in halves,Irrelevant
Die casting involves pouring molten metal into a steel die of the desired shape and letting the metal harden,Relevant
As it cools the metal assumes the same shape as the die,Irrelevant
At this time an optional chromium coating can be applied to the interior surfaces of the halves that correspond to a completed missile s cavity,Irrelevant
The halves are then welded together and nozzles are added at the tail end of the body after it has been welded,Irrelevant
Moveable fins are now added at predetermined points along the missile body,Relevant
The fins can be attached to mechanical joints that are then welded to the outside of the body or they can be inserted into recesses purposely milled into the body,Relevant
The propellant must be carefully applied to the missile cavity in order to ensure a uniform coating as any irregularities will result in an unreliable burning rate which in turn detracts from the performance of the missile,Relevant
The best means of achieving a uniform coating is to apply the propellant by using centrifugal force,Relevant
This application calledcasting is done in an industrial centrifuge that is well shielded and situated in an isolated location as a precaution against fire or explosion,Irrelevant
The principal laser componentsthe photo detecting sensor and optical filtersare assembled in a series of operations that are separate from the rest of the missile s construction,Relevant
Circuits that support the laser system are then soldered onto pre printed boards extra attention is given to optical materials at this time to protect them from excessive heat as this can alter the wavelength of light that the missile will be able to detect,Relevant
The assembled laser subsystem is now set aside pending final assembly,Relevant
The circuit boards for the electronics suite are also assembled independently from the rest of the missile,Relevant
If called for by the design microchips are added to the boards at this time,Relevant
The guidance system laser components plus the electronics suite can now be integrated by linking the requisite circuit boards and inserting the entire assembly into the missile body through an access panel,Relevant
The missile s control surfaces are then linked with the guidance system by a series of relay wires also entered into the missile body via access panels,Relevant
The photo detecting sensor and its housing however are added at this point only for beam riding missiles in which case the housing is carefully bolted to the exterior diameter of the missile near its rear facing backward to interpret the laser signals from the parent aircraft,Relevant
Insertion of the warhead constitutes the final assembly phase of guided missileconstruction,Irrelevant
Great care must be exercised during this process as mistakes can lead to catastrophic accidents,Irrelevant
Simple fastening techniques such as bolting or riveting serve to attach the warhead without risking safety hazards,Relevant
For guidance systems that home in on reflected laser light the photo detecting sensor in its housing is bolted into place at the tip of the warhead,Relevant
On completion of this final phase of assembly the manufacturer has successfully constructed on of the most complicated sophisticated and potentially dangerous pieces of hardware in use today,Relevant
First ingredients are loaded into one of two machines a tumbling blender or a ribbon blender,Relevant
The tumbling blender shaped like a rectangular box is turned and shaken from outside by a machine while the ribbon blender is a cylinder fitted with blades to scrape and mix the ingredients,Relevant
After the ingredients inside the blender have been mixed a doorway at the bottom of the bowl is opened,Relevant
With the blender still agitating the ingredients the mix is allowed to run out onto a conveyor belt or other channeling device,Relevant
The belt then moves the detergent to another area of the factory where it can be dropped into boxes or cartons for delivery to wholesalers or distributors,Relevant
In this method dry ingredients for a detergent are first fed into a large machine known as aShuggi agglomeratorShuggi is the manufacturer ,Relevant
Inside the agglomerator sharp whirling blades mix the material to a fine consistency the process resembles food being textured inside a food processor,Relevant
After the dry ingredients have been blended liquid ingredients are sprayed on the dry mix through nozzles fitted into the agglomerator s walls,Relevant
The blending continues causing an exothermic heat producing reaction to occur,Relevant
The resulting mixture is a hot viscous liquid similar to gelatin that hasn t hardened,Relevant
Next the liquid is allowed to flow out of the agglomerator,Relevant
As it leaves the machine it collects on a drying belt where its own heat exposure to air and hot air blowers render it friableeasy to crush or crumble,Relevant
The newly made detergent is then pulverized and pushed through sizing screens that ensure that no large lumps of unmixed product go out to the market,Relevant
The result of this process is a dry detergent made up of granules of the mixed detergent,Irrelevant
In this process ingredients are dissolved in water to create a slurry,Irrelevant
With a pump the slurry is blown through nozzles inside the top of a cone shaped container as hot dry air is simultaneously forced into the bottom of the cone,Relevant
As the slurry dries beads of dry detergent fall to the bottom of the cone where they can be collected for packaging,Relevant
If the detergent is to be liquid rather than powder it is simply mixed back inafter all ingredients are blendedwith a solution consisting of water and various chemicals known assolubilizers,Irrelevant
The solubilizers help the water and detergent blend together more fully and evenly,Relevant
Manufacturing the conventional rotary lawn mower requires precision inventory control strategic placement of parts and personnel and synchronization of people and tasks,Irrelevant
In some instances robotic cells are used in conjunction with a trained labor force,Irrelevant
Trucked into the plant s loading dock the components are moved by forklifts or overhead trolleys to other centers for forming machining painting or if they require no additional work upon arrival assembly,Relevant
The steel mower pan the largest single part and one used in various models is first machine stamped under great heat and pressure,Relevant
The pan is then transported to a robotic cell where a plasma cutter creates apertures in it,Relevant
The termplasmarefers to any of a number of gases argon is commonly used that can be raised to high temperature and highly ionized by being passed through a constricted electrical arc,Irrelevant
When directed through the narrow opening of a torch this hot ionized gas can be used for both cutting and welding,Irrelevant
After other elements such as baffles deflecting plates are welded on the finished pan and a number of other exposed parts are powder painted in a sealed room,Irrelevant
Powder painting entails thoroughly washing the parts in alkaline and phosphate solutions and rinsing them to seal the surfaces,Relevant
The parts are then attached to overhead conveyors and run through apaintbooth,Relevant
Fine paint particles are sprayed from a gun that imbues them with an electrostatic chargeopposite to the charge given to the part being paintedthat causes the paint to adhere to the surface of the parts evenly,Relevant
Next the parts are baked in ovens to produce a permanently fixed enamel like coating,Relevant
The panand other parts are now ready to withstand years of exposure to corrosive grass fluids and the constant peppering from dirt and debris kicked up in the cutting process,Irrelevant
The handlebar is created in a robotic cell whose mechanical arms perform three operations,Relevant
In a bender the tubing is first bent in at least four places,Relevant
A second press operation flattens the ends and a third pierces fourteen or so round and square holes in the tubing,Relevant
These holes will accommodate the starting mechanism blade and wheel drive control and the pan attachment,Relevant
The finished handlebar is then transported to a subassembly station where many of the controls are added,Relevant
The other major subassemblies are also created at various plant centers using formed machined or purchased materials and standard hardware,Relevant
Parts purchased from outside suppliers include engines built to manufacturer s physical and performance specifications tires shift mechanisms wiring harnesses and bearings,Irrelevant
Injection molded plastic parts are purchased for use in side discharge chutes covers and plugs,Relevant
Injection molding refers to a process in which molten plastic is squirted into a mold and then allowed to cool,Irrelevant
As it cools the plastic assumes the shape of the mold,Relevant
Assembly teams put the six or more major subassemblies together on a rolling line at a pace determined by the task and skills required,Irrelevant
The engine is first placed upside down in a frame fixture and the mower pan is bolted down along with the drive mechanism,Relevant
Then come the rear axle brackets and rods to secure the shift controls,Relevant
The blade and accompanying clutch wheels and parts are fastened to the engine through the pan opening with preset air driven torque wrenches,Relevant
After another team member adds hardware and wheels the unit is flipped onto its wheels,Relevant
The handlebar is attached and control cables are secured and set,Relevant
Finally the mowereach moweris performance tested before shipment to dealers where some final set up adjustments are made,Relevant
The uses of light bulbs range from street lights toautomobileheadlights to flashlights,Irrelevant
For each use the individual bulb differs in size and wattage which determine the amount of light the bulb gives offlumens ,Irrelevant
However all incandescent light bulbs have the three basic partsthe filament the bulb and the base,Irrelevant
Originally produced by hand the light bulb manufacture is now almost entirely automated,Irrelevant
The filament is manufactured through a process known asdrawing in which tungsten is mixed with a binder material and pulled through a diea shaped orificeinto a fine wire,Relevant
Next the wire is wound around a metal bar called amandrelin order to mold it into its proper coiled shape and then it is heated in an process known asannealing,Relevant
This process softens the wire and makes its structure more uniform,Irrelevant
The mandrel is then dissolved in acid,Relevant
The coiled filament is attached to the lead in wires,Relevant
The lead in wires have hooks at their ends which are either pressed over the end of the filament or in larger bulbs spot welded,Relevant
The glass bulbs or casings are produced using a ribbon machine,Relevant
After heating ina furnace a continuous ribbon of glass moves along a conveyor belt,Relevant
Precisely aligned air nozzles blow the glass through holes in the conveyor belt into molds creating the casings,Relevant
A ribbon machine moving at top speed can produce more than 50 000 bulbs per hour,Irrelevant
After the casings are blown they are cooled and then cut off of the ribbon machine,Relevant
Next the inside of the bulb is coated with silica to remove the glare caused by a glowing uncovered filament,Relevant
The company emblem and bulb wattage are then stamped onto the outside top of each casing,Relevant
The base of the bulb is also constructed using molds,Relevant
It is made with indentations in the shape of a screw so that it can easily fit into the socket of a light fixture,Irrelevant
Once the filament base and bulb are made they are fitted together by machines,Relevant
First the filament is mounted to the stem assembly with its ends clamped to the two lead in wires,Relevant
Next the air inside the bulb is evacuated and the casing is filled with an argon and nitrogen mixture,Relevant
These gases ensure a longer life for the filament,Irrelevant
The tungsten will eventually evaporate and break,Relevant
As it evaporates it leaves a dark deposit on the bulb known asbulb wall blackening,Irrelevant
Finally the base and the bulb are sealed,Relevant
The base slides onto the end of the glass bulb such that no other material is needed to keep them together,Relevant
Instead their conforming shapes allow the two pieces to be held together snugly with the lead in wires touching the aluminum base to ensure proper electrical contact,Relevant
After testing bulbs are placed in their packages and shipped to consumers,Relevant
First a semiconductor wafer is made,Relevant
The particular material compositionGaAs GaP or something in betweenis determined by the color of LED being fabricated,Irrelevant
The crystalline semiconductor is grown in a high temperature high pressure chamber,Irrelevant
Gallium arsenic and or phosphor are purified and mixed together in the chamber,Irrelevant
The heat and pressure liquify and press the components together so that they are forced into a solution,Relevant
To keep them from escaping into the pressurized gas in the chamber they are often covered with a layer of liquid boron oxide which seals them off so that they must stick together,Relevant
This is known asliquid encapsulation or theCzochralski crystal growth method,Irrelevant
After the elements are mixed in a uniform solution a rod is dipped into the solution and pulled out slowly,Relevant
The solution cools and crystallizes on the end of the rod as it is lifted out of the chamber forming a long cylindrical crystal ingot orboule of GaAs GaP or GaAsP,Relevant
Think of this as baking the cake,Irrelevant
The boule is then sliced into very thin wafers of semiconductor approximately 10 mils thick or about as thick as a garbage bag,Relevant
The wafers are polished until the surfaces are very smooth so that they will readily accept more layers of semiconductor on their surface,Relevant
The principle is similar to sanding a table before painting it,Irrelevant
Each wafer should be a single crystal of material of uniform composition,Irrelevant
Unfortunately there will sometimes be imperfections in the crystals that make the LED function poorly,Irrelevant
Think of imperfections as unmixed bits of flower orsugarsuspended in the cake during baking,Irrelevant
Imperfections can also result from the polishing process such imperfections also degrade device performance,Irrelevant
The more imperfections the less the wafer behaves like a single crystal without a regular crystalline structure the material will not function as a semiconductor,Irrelevant
Next the wafers are cleaned through a rigorous chemical and ultrasonic process using various solvents,Relevant
This process removes dirt dust or organic matter that may have settled on the polished wafer surface,Relevant
The cleaner the processing the better the resulting LED will be,Irrelevant
Additional layers of semiconductor crystal are grown on the surface of the wafer like adding more layers to the cake,Irrelevant
This is one way to add impurities or dopants to the crystal,Irrelevant
The crystal layers are grown this time by a process calledLiquid Phase EpitaxyLPE ,Irrelevant
In this technique epitaxial layerssemiconductor layers that have the same crystalline orientation as the substrate beloware deposited on a wafer while it is drawn under reservoirs of molten GaAsP,Relevant
The reservoirs have appropriate dopants mixed through them,Irrelevant
The wafer rests on a graphite slide which is pushed through a channel under a container holding the molten liquid ormelt as it is called ,Relevant
Different dopants can be added in sequential melts or several in the same melt creating layers of material with different electronic densities,Irrelevant
The deposited layers will become a continuation of the wafer s crystal structure,Irrelevant
LPE creates an exceptionally uniform layer of material which makes it a preferred growth and doping technique,Relevant
The layers formed are several microns thick,Relevant
After depositing epitaxial layers it may be necessary to add additional dopants to alter the characteristics of the diode for color or efficiency,Relevant
If additional doping is done the wafer is again placed in a high temperature furnace tube where it is immersed in a gaseous atmosphere containing the dopantsnitrogen or zinc ammonium are the most common,Relevant
Nitrogen is often added to the top layer of the diode to make the light more yellow or green,Relevant
Metal contacts are then defined on the wafer,Relevant
The contact pattern is determined in the design stage and depends on whether the diodes are to be used singly or in combination,Relevant
Contact patterns are reproduced in photoresist a light sensitive compound the liquid resist is deposited in drops while the wafer spins distributing it over the surface,Relevant
The resist is hardened by a brief low temperature baking about 215 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Next the master pattern or mask is duplicated on the photoresist by placing it over the wafer and exposing the resist with ultraviolet light the same way a photograph is made from a negative ,Relevant
Exposed areas of the resist are washed away with developer and unexposed areas remain covering the semiconductor layers,Relevant
Contact metal is now evaporated onto the pattern filling in the exposed areas,Relevant
Evaporation takes place in another high temperature chamber this time vacuum sealed,Relevant
A chunk of metal is heated to temperatures that cause it to vaporize,Relevant
It condenses and sticks to the exposed semiconductor wafer much like steam will fog a cold window,Relevant
The photoresist can then be washed away with acetone leaving only the metal contacts behind,Relevant
Depending on the final mounting scheme for the LED an additional layer of metal may be evaporated on the back side of the wafer,Relevant
Any deposited metal must undergo an annealing process in which the wafer is heated to several hundred degrees and allowed to remain in a furnace with an inert atmosphere of hydrogen or nitrogen flowing through it for periods up to several hours,Relevant
During this time the metal and the semiconductor bond together chemically so the contacts don t flake off,Irrelevant
A single 2 inch diameter wafer produced in this manner will have the same pattern repeated up to 6000 times on it this gives an indication of the size of the finished diodes,Relevant
The diodes are cut apart either by cleaving snapping the wafer along a crystal plane or by sawing with a diamond saw,Relevant
Each small segment cut from the wafer is called a die,Irrelevant
A difficult and error prone process cutting results in far less than 6000 total useable LEDs and is one of the biggest challenges in limiting production costs of semiconductor devices,Irrelevant
Individual dies are mounted on the appropriate package,Relevant
If the diode will be used by itself as an indicator light or for jewelry for example it is mounted on two metal leads about two inches long,Irrelevant
Usually in this case the back of the wafer is coated with metal and forms an electrical contact with the lead it rests on,Irrelevant
A tiny gold wire is soldered to the other lead and wire bonded to the patterned contacts on the surface of the die,Relevant
In wire bonding the end of the wire is pressed down on the contact metal with a very fine needle,Relevant
The gold is soft enough to deform and stick to a like metal surface,Relevant
Finally the entire assembly is sealed in plastic,Relevant
The wires and die are suspended inside a mold that is shaped accordingto the optical requirements of the package with a lens or connector at the end and the mold is filled with liquid plastic or epoxy,Relevant
The epoxy is cured and the package is complete,Relevant
The manufacturing process is easiest to understand if it is viewed as three separate steps melting and mixing the lipstick pouring the mixture into the tube and packaging the product for sale,Irrelevant
Since the lipstick mass can be mixed and stored for later use mixing does not have to happen at the same time as pouring,Irrelevant
Once the lipstick is in the tube packaging for retail sale is highly variable depending on how the product is to be marketed,Irrelevant
First the raw ingredients for the lipstick are melted and mixedseparately because of the different types of ingredients used,Relevant
One mixture contains the solvents a second contains the oils and a third contains the fats and waxy materials,Irrelevant
These are heated in separatestainless steelor ceramic containers,Relevant
The solvent solution and liquid oils are then mixed with the color pigments,Relevant
Themixture passes through a roller mill grinding the pigment to avoid a grainy feel to the lipstick,Relevant
This process introduces air into the oil and pigment mixture so mechanical working of the mixture is required,Irrelevant
The mixture is stirred for several hours at this point some producers use vacuum equipment to withdraw the air,Relevant
After the pigment mass is ground and mixed it is added to the hot wax mass until a uniform color and consistency is obtained,Relevant
The fluid lipstick can then be strained and molded or it may be poured into pans and stored for future molding,Relevant
If the fluid lipstick is to be used immediately the melt is maintained at temperature with agitation so that trapped air escapes,Relevant
If the lipstick mass is stored before it is used it must be reheated checked for color consistency and adjusted to specifications then maintained at the melt temperature with agitation until it can be poured,Relevant
As expected lipsticks are always prepared in batches because of the different color pigments that can be used,Irrelevant
The size of the batch and the number of tubes of lipstick produced at one time will depend on the popularity of the particular shade being produced,Irrelevant
This will determine the manufacturing technique automated or manual that is used,Irrelevant
Lipstick may be produced in highly automated processes at rates of up to 2 400 tubes an hour or in essentially manual operations at rates around 150 tubes per hour,Irrelevant
The steps in the process basically differ only in the volume produced,Irrelevant
Once the lipstick mass is mixed and free of air it is ready to be poured into the tube,Relevant
A variety of machine setups are used depending on the equipment that the manufacturer has but high volume batches are generally run through a melter that agitates the lipstick mass and maintains it as a liquid,Irrelevant
For smaller manually run batches the mass is maintained at the desired mix temperature with agitation in a melter controlled by an operator,Relevant
The melted mass is dispensed into a mold which consists of the bottom portion of the metal or plastic tube and a shaping portion that fits snugly with the tube,Relevant
Lipstick is poured up side down so that the bottom of the tube is at the top of the mold,Relevant
Any excess is scraped from the mold,Relevant
The lipstick is cooled automated molds are kept cold manually produced molds are transferred to a refrigeration unit and separated from the mold and the bottom of the tube is sealed,Relevant
The lipstick then passes through a flaming cabinet or is flamed by hand to seal pinholes and improve the finish,Relevant
The lipstick is visually inspected for air holes mold separation lines or blemishes and is reworked if necessary,Relevant
For obvious reasons rework of the lipstick must be limited demonstrating the importance of the early steps in removing air from the lipstick mass,Irrelevant
Lipstick is reworked by hand with a spatula,Relevant
This can be done in line or the tube can be removed from the manufacturing process and reworked,Relevant
After the lipstick is retracted and the tube is capped the lipstick is ready for labeling and packaging,Relevant
Labels identify the batch and are applied as part of the automated operation,Relevant
While there is a great deal of emphasis on quality and appearance of the finished lipstick product less emphasis is placed on the appearance of lip balms,Irrelevant
Lip balms are always produced in an automated process except for experimental or test batches ,Irrelevant
The heated liquid is poured into the tube in the retracted position the tube is then capped by machinea far less laborious process,Relevant
The final step in the manufacturing process is the packaging of the lipstick tube,Relevant
There are a variety of packaging options available ranging from bulk packs to individual packs and including packaging as a component in a makeup kit or special promotional offering,Irrelevant
Lip balms are packaged in bulk generally with minimum protection to prevent shipping damage,Relevant
Packaging for lipsticks varies depending on what will happen at the point of sale in the retail outlet,Irrelevant
Packaging may or may not be highly automated and the package used depends on the end use of the product rather than on the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
Making passive matrix LCDs is a multi step process,Irrelevant
The surface and rear glass of the display is first polished washed and coated with silicon dioxide SiO2,Relevant
Next a layer of indium tin oxide is evaporated onto the glass and etched into the desired pattern,Relevant
A layer of long chain polymer is then applied to allow the liquid crystals to align properly followed by a sealing resin,Relevant
The spacers next are put into place and the glass sandwich is filled with the liquid crystal material,Relevant
First the two glass substrates must be cut to the proper size polished and washed,Relevant
Cutting can be done with a diamond saw or scribe while polishing involves a process calledlapping in which the glass is held against a rotating wheel that has abrasive particles embedded in it,Irrelevant
After being washed and dried the substrates are coated with a layer of silicon dioxide,Relevant
Next the transparent electrode pattern must be made on the substrates,Relevant
This is done by completely coating both front and rear glass surfaces with a very thin layer of indium tin oxide,Relevant
Manufacturers then make a mask of the desired pattern using either a silk screening or photolithography process,Relevant
They apply the finished mask to the fully coated glass and areas of indium tin oxide that are not needed are etched away chemically,Relevant
Alternatively finer definition can be achieved by using glass that has a layer of etching resistant light sensitive material calledphotoresist above the indium tin oxide film,Relevant
A mask with the desired pattern is placed over the glass and the glass is bombarded with ultraviolet light,Relevant
This light causes the resistive layer it shines on to lose its resistance to etching allowing the chemicals to eat away both the exposed photoresist and the indium tin oxide below it thus forming the pattern,Irrelevant
The unnecessary photoresist that remains can then be removed with other chemicals,Relevant
A second variety of resistive film resists etching onlyafterit is exposed to ultraviolet light in this case a negative mask of the pattern must be used,Irrelevant
Regardless of which method is used the patterns on the two substrates are designed to overlap only in specific places a design that ensures that the thin strips of indium tin oxide conveying voltage to each element have no electrode positioned directly opposite that might show up while the cell is working,Irrelevant
After the electrode pattern is in place the substrates must be coated with a polymer,Relevant
The polymer allows the liquid crystals to align properly with the glass surface,Relevant
Polyvinyl alcohol polyamides and some silanes can be used,Irrelevant
Polyamides are the most popular agents because polyvinyl alcohol is subject to moisture problems and silanes produce a thin unreliable coating,Irrelevant
After coating the glass manufacturers then stroke the polymer coat in a single direction with soft material,Relevant
This can result in small parallel grooves being etched into the polymer or it may simply stretch the polymer coat,Irrelevant
In any case this process forces the liquid crystals to lie parallel to the direction of the stroke,Relevant
The crystals may be aligned another way by evaporating silicon oxide onto the glass surface at an oblique angle,Relevant
This procedure is used to make most digitalwatchdisplays but is not convenient for making large scale displays,Relevant
It also does not yield the low tilt angle possible with the previous method,Irrelevant
If LCD makers want to align liquid crystals perpendicular to the glass surface another technique is used coating the glass with an amphophilic material,Relevant
This is material whose molecules display affinity for water at one end of the molecule and repulsion from water at the other end,Irrelevant
One endthe affinity endadheres to the glass surface while the other endthe repulsing endpoints into the liquid crystal area repelling the liquid crystals and forming them into an alignment that is perpendicular to the glass surface,Irrelevant
A sealing resin is next applied to the substrates followed by plastic spacers that will give the liquid crystal cell the proper thickness,Relevant
Next the liquid crystal material is injected into the appropriate area between the two glass substrates,Relevant
The thickness of the LCD cell is usually restricted to 5 25 micrometers,Irrelevant
Because proper thickness is crucial for cell operation and because spacers don t always achieve uniform thickness LCD makers sometimes put appropriately sized glass fibers or beads in the liquid crystal material,Irrelevant
The beads or fibers cannot be seen by the naked eye,Irrelevant
They help hold the cell at the proper thickness while the sealant material is setting,Irrelevant
To make LCDs more visible polarizers are added,Relevant
These are usually made from stretched polyvinyl alcohol films that have iodine in them and that are sandwiched between cellulose acetate layers,Irrelevant
Colored polarizers made using dye instead of iodine are also available,Irrelevant
Manufacturers glue the polarizer to the glass using an acrylic adhesive and cover it with a plastic protective film,Relevant
They can make reflective polarizers which also are used in LCDs by incorporating a simple metal foil reflector,Irrelevant
After the polarizer film is attached the unit is allowed to age,Relevant
Finally the finished glass display assembly is mounted to the circuit boards containing the control and drive electronics,Relevant
Then the entire package is ready to be mounted to the device using the LCDlaptop computer fax machine clock etc,Relevant
Lube oil is extracted from crude oil which undergoes a preliminary purification process sedimentation before it is pumped into fractionating towers,Irrelevant
A typical high efficiency fractionating tower 25 to 35 feet 7 6 to 10 6 meters in diameter and up to 400 feet 122 meters tall is constructed of high grade steels to resist the corrosive compounds present in crude oils inside it is fitted with an ascending series of condensate collecting trays,Irrelevant
Within a tower the thousands of hydrocarbons in crude oil are separated from each other by a process calledfractional distillation,Irrelevant
As the vapors rise up through the tower the various fractions cool condense and return to liquid form at different rates determined by their respective boiling points the lower the boiling point of the fraction the higher it rises before condensing ,Relevant
Natural gas reaches its boiling point first followed by gasoline kerosene fuel oil lubricants and tars,Relevant
The crude oil is transported from the oil well to the refinery by pipeline or tanker ship,Relevant
At the refinery the oil undergoes sedimentation to remove any water and solid contaminants such as sand and rock that maybe suspended in it,Irrelevant
During this process the crude is pumped into large holding tanks where the water and oil are allowed to separate and the contaminants settle out of the oil,Relevant
Next the crude oil is heated to about 700 degrees Fahrenheit 371 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
At this temperature it breaks down into a mixture of hot vapor and liquid that is then pumped into the bottom of the first of two fractionating towers,Relevant
Here the hot hydrocarbon vapors float upward,Irrelevant
As they cool they condense and are collected in different trays installed at different levels in the tower,Relevant
In this tower normal atmospheric pressure is maintained continuously and about 80 percent of the crude oil vaporizes,Relevant
The remaining 20 percent of the oil is then reheated and pumped into a second tower wherein vacuum pressure lowers the residual oil s boiling point so that it can be made to vaporize at a lower temperature,Relevant
The heavier compounds with higher boiling points such as tar and the inorganic compounds remain behind for further processing,Irrelevant
After further processing to remove unwanted compounds the lube oil that has been collected in the two fractionating towers is passed through several ultrafine filters which remove remaining impurities,Relevant
Aromatics one such contaminant contain six carbon rings that would affect the lube oil s viscosity if they weren t removed in a process calledsolvent extraction,Irrelevant
Solvent extraction is possible because aromatics are more soluble in the solvent than the lube oil fraction is,Irrelevant
When the lube oil is treated with the solvent the aromatics dissolve later after the solvent has been removed the aromatics can be recovered from it,Irrelevant
Finally the oil is mixed with additives to give it the desired physical properties such as the ability to withstand low temperatures ,Relevant
At this point the lube oil is subjected to a variety of quality control tests that assess its viscosity specific gravity color flash and fire points,Relevant
Oil that meets quality standards is then packaged for sale and distribution,Relevant
Most mattress manufacturers subcontract the production of the innerspring unit to an outside firm that specializes in making springs,Irrelevant
Once the completed spring unit is received and inspected the workers manually apply the insulator,Relevant
Next they apply the cushioning layers that will determine the feel and comfort of the final product,Relevant
While the mattress is being built up in one part of the plant the decorative cover that will serve as the exterior for the top bottom and sides is being made in another part,Relevant
Usually this cover is made on a giant quilting machine which controls a multitude of needles that stitch the cover to a layer of backing material,Irrelevant
The stitching chosen serves both useful and ornamental purposes as it must prevent the mattress cover from slipping or creeping over the layers of cushioning in addition to creating a visually pleasing exterior,Irrelevant
Once the fabric is quilted it is cut into panels that will fit the top and bottom of the mattress,Relevant
The side panels are often cut from this same composite or made separately on a border machine,Relevant
If side handles or vents are to be added they are attached to the side panels before these are applied to the mattress,Irrelevant
Specially modified sewing machines are used to attach the flanges to the top and bottom panels and the hogs rings are stapled to the flanges,Irrelevant
Everything is now ready for the closing operation during which the hogs rings will be secured to the innerspring unit,Irrelevant
The closing operation is of one of the most highly skilled and critical procedures in the entire process,Irrelevant
It is done with a movable sewing head that is mounted on a track,Irrelevant
Tape edge operators manually feed the top bottom and side panels and a heavy duty binding tape into the sewing machine as it moves around the mattress,Relevant
As this combination of materials is fed into the machine the operators uses their skill to feed the proper amount of each material into the machine to produce a professionally tailored product,Irrelevant
Some of the highest quality mattresses may also feature a pillowtop a panel filled with soft upholstery and attached to the top and bottom panels of the mattress for a more luxurious feel and appearance,Irrelevant
Prequilted the pillowtop is then taped to the mattress,Relevant
If the desired boxspring has a spiked coil design it is made by stapling the bottom of each coil to a flat wooden frame,Relevant
A wire grid is then placed on top of the springs and once aligned manually locked to them,Relevant
A thin layer of upholstery is applied to the top,Relevant
If the desired boxspring contains no springs it consists of a wooden frame that may or may not have a layer of upholstery attached to its top,Irrelevant
Regardless of the internal composition the frame is usually inserted into a pre sewn cover that encases the top and sides of the unit,Irrelevant
A border fabric that matches the mattress exterior is applied to the sides and a dust cover is added to the face,Relevant
Once the units are complete they are inspected for quality,Relevant
If every thing is in order they are labeled with the content and the contingent do not remove tag required by law to ensure the consumer that the contents are properly represented in the labeling,Relevant
The finished product is then transported to the packing area,Relevant
Here it is inserted by hand or by automated machinery into protective plastic or paper covers,Relevant
Additional information about the warranty safety and care of the product is also included in the packaging,Relevant
The process of manufacturing a microwave oven starts with the cavity and the door,Irrelevant
First the frame is formed using automatic metal forming presses that make about 12 to 15 parts per minute,Relevant
The frame is then rinsed in alkaline cleaner to get rid of any dirt or oil and further rinsed with water to get rid of the alkaline solution,Relevant
Next each part is treated with zinc phosphate which prepares it for electro deposition,Relevant
Electro deposition consists of immersing the parts in apainttank at 200 volts for 2 5 minutes,Irrelevant
The resulting coating is about 1 5 mils thick,Irrelevant
The parts are then moved through a paint bake operation where the paint is cured at 300 degrees Fahrenheit 149 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes,Relevant
After the door has been painted a perforated metal plate is attached to its window aperture,Relevant
The plate reflects microwaves but allows light to enter the cavity the door will not be attached to the cavity until later when the chassis is assembled ,Irrelevant
The magnetron tube assembly consists of a cathode cylinder a filament heater a metal anode and an antenna,Irrelevant
The filament is attached to the cathode and the cathode is enclosed in the anode cylinder this cell will provide the electricity that will help to generate the microwaves,Relevant
Metal cooling fins are welded to the anode cylinder and a powerful magnet is placed around the anode to provide the magnetic field in which the microwaves will be generated,Relevant
A metal strap holds the complete assembly together,Relevant
A thermal protector is mounted directly on the magnetron to prevent damage to the tube from overheating,Relevant
An antenna enclosed in a glass tube is mounted on top of the anode and the air within the tube is pumped out to create a vacuum,Relevant
The waveguide is connected to the magnetron on top of the protruding antenna while a blower motor used to cool the metal fins of the magnetron is attached directly to the tube,Relevant
Finally a plastic fan is attached to the motor where it will draw air from outside the oven and direct it towards the vanes,Relevant
This completes the magnetron subassembly,Irrelevant
The chassis assembly work is performed on a palleta work holding device used in conjunction with other toolslocated at the station,Irrelevant
First the main chassis is placed on the pallet and the cavity is screwed on to the chassis,Relevant
Next the door is attached to the cavity and chassis by means of hinges,Relevant
The magnetron tube is then bolted to the side of the cavity and the main chassis,Relevant
The circuit that produces the voltage required to operate the magnetron tube consists of a large transformer an oil based capacitor and a high voltage rectifier,Irrelevant
All of these components are mounted directly on the chassis close to the magnetron tube,Relevant
The stirrer fan used to circulate the microwaves is mounted on top of the cavity,Relevant
Some manufacturers use a pulley to drive the fan from the magnetron blower motor others use a separate stirrer motor attached directly to the fan,Irrelevant
Once the stirrer fan is attached a stirrer shield is screwed on top of the fan assembly,Relevant
The shield prevents dirt and grease from entering the waveguide where they could produce arcing and damage the magnetron,Irrelevant
The cook switch provides power to the transformer by energizing a relay and a timer,Irrelevant
The relay is mounted close to the power transformer while the timer is mounted on the control board,Irrelevant
The defrost switch works like the cook switch activating a motor and timer to operate the defrost cycle,Irrelevant
Also mounted on the control board are a timer bell that rings when the cooking cycle is complete and a light switch that allows viewing of the cavity,Irrelevant
A number of interlocking switches are mounted near the top and bottom of the door area,Relevant
The interlocking switches are sometimes grouped together with a safety switch that monitors the other switches and provides protection if the door accidently opens during oven operation,Irrelevant
A front panel that allows the operator to select the various settings and features available for cooking is attached to the chassis,Relevant
Behind the front panel the control circuit board is attached,Relevant
The board which controls the various programmed operations in their proper sequence when the switches are pushed on the front panel is connected to the various components and the front panel by means of plug in sockets and cables,Relevant
The outer case of the microwave is made of metal and is assembled on a roll former,Irrelevant
The case is slipped onto the preassembled microwave oven and bolted to the main chassis,Relevant
The power cords and dial knobs are now attached to the oven and it is sent for automatic testing,Relevant
Most manufacturers run the oven from 50 100 hours continuously as part of the testing process,Irrelevant
After testing is complete a palletizer robot records the model and serial data of the oven for inventory purposes and the oven is sent for packaging,Relevant
This completes the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
The first step in manufacturing any mirror is cutting the outline of the glass blank to suit the application,Relevant
If the mirror is for anautomobile for example the glass will be cut out to fit in the mirror mount on the car,Irrelevant
Although some mirror manufacturers cut their own glass others receive glass that has already been cut into blanks,Irrelevant
Regardless of who cuts the glass very hard finely pointed blades are used to do the cutting,Irrelevant
Diamond scribes or sawssharp metal points or saws with diamond dust embedded in themare often used because the diamond will wear down the glass before the glass wears down the diamond,Irrelevant
The cutting method used depends entirely on the final shape the mirror will take,Irrelevant
In one method the blades or scribes may be used to cut partway through the glass pressure can then be used to break the glass along the score line,Irrelevant
In another method a machine uses a diamond saw to cut all the way through the glass by drawing the blade back and forth or up and down multiple times like an automated bandsaw,Irrelevant
Cutting is usually done before the metal coating is applied because the coating may flake off the glass as a result of the cut,Irrelevant
An alternative to cutting the glass to form blanks is to mold the glass in its molten state,Irrelevant
Blanks are then placed in optical grinding machines,Relevant
These machines consist of large base plates full of depressions that hold the blanks,Irrelevant
The blank filled base is placed against another metal plate with the desired surface shape flat convex or concave,Relevant
A grinding compounda gritty liquidis spread over the glass blanks as they are rubbed or rolled against the curved surface,Relevant
The action is similar to grinding spices with a mortar and pestle,Irrelevant
The grit in the compound gradually wears away the glass surface until it assumes the same shape as the grinding plate,Relevant
Finer and finer grits are used until the surface is very smooth and even,Irrelevant
Hand grinding techniques exist as well but they are extremely time consuming and difficult to control,Irrelevant
They are only used in cases where mechanical grinding would be impossible as is the case with very large or unusually shaped surfaces,Irrelevant
A commercial optical grinder can accommodate 50 to 200 blanks which are all polished simultaneously,Irrelevant
This is much more efficient than hand grinding,Irrelevant
Even specialty optics can be made mechanically in adjustable equipment,Irrelevant
When the glass surfaces are shaped appropriately and polished to a smooth finish they are coated with whatever reflective material the designer has chosen,Relevant
Regardless of the coating material it is applied in an apparatus called an evaporator,Relevant
The evaporator is a large vacuum chamber with an upper plate for supporting the blank mirrors and a lower crucible for melting the coating metal,Irrelevant
It is so called because metal is heated in the crucible to the point that it evaporates into the vacuum depositing a coating on the surface of the glass much like hot breath will steam a cold window,Irrelevant
Blanks are centered over holes in the upper plate that allow the metal vapor to reach the surface of the glass,Relevant
Metals can be heated to several hundreds or thousands of degrees depending on the boiling point of the metal before they vaporize,Irrelevant
The temperature and timing for this procedure are controlled very precisely to achieve exactly the right thickness of metal,Relevant
This method of coating creates very uniform and highly reflective surfaces,Relevant
The shape of the holes in the upper plate will be transferred to the glass in metal likepaintthrough a stencil,Relevant
This effect is often used to intentionally pattern the mirror,Irrelevant
Metal stencils or masks can be applied to the surface of the glass to create one or more patterns,Relevant
Dielectric coatingseither as reflective layers or as protective layers over metal onesare applied in much the same way except that gases are used instead of metal chunks,Relevant
Silicon oxides and silicon nitrides are typically used as dielectric coatings,Irrelevant
When these gases combine in extreme heat they react to form a solid substance,Irrelevant
This reaction product forms a coating just like metal does,Irrelevant
Several evaporation steps may be combined to make a multiple layer coating,Irrelevant
Clear dielectric materials may be evaporated on top of metal or other dielectrics to change the reflective or mechanical properties of a surface,Irrelevant
Mirrors with silvering on the back of the glass for instance often have an opaque dielectric layer applied to improve the reflectivity and keep the metal from scratching,Irrelevant
One way mirrors are the exception to this procedure in which case great care must be taken not to damage the thin metal coating,Irrelevant
Finally when the proper coatings have been applied the finished mirror is mounted in a base or packed carefully in a shock resistant package for shipping,Relevant
Early methods of making nail polish used a variety of methods that today look charmingly amateurish,Irrelevant
One common technique was to mix cleaned scraps of movie film and other cellulose with alcohol and castor oil and leave the mixture to soak overnight in a covered container,Relevant
The mixture was then strained colored and perfumed,Relevant
Though recognizable as nail polish the product was far from what we have available today,Irrelevant
The modern manufacturing process is a very sophisticated operation utilizing highly skilled workers advanced machinery and even robotics,Irrelevant
Today s consumers expect a nail polish to apply smoothly evenly and easily to set relatively quickly and to be resistant to chipping and peeling,Irrelevant
In addition the polish should be dermatologically innocuous,Irrelevant
The pigments are mixed with nitrocellulose and plasticizer using a two roll differential speed mill,Relevant
This mill grinds the pigment between a pair of rollers that are able to work with increasing speed as the pigment is ground down,Relevant
The goal is to produce fine dispersion of the color,Irrelevant
A variation of this mill is the Banbury Mixer used also in the production of rubber forrubber bands ,Irrelevant
When properly and fully milled the mixture is removed from the mill in sheet form and then broken up into small chips for mixing with the solvent,Relevant
The mixing is performed instainless steelkettles that can hold anywhere from 5 to 2 000 gallons,Relevant
Stainless steel must be used because the nitrocellulose is extremely reactive in the presence of iron,Irrelevant
The kettles are jacketed so that the mixture can be cooled by circulating cold water or another liquid around the outside of the kettle,Relevant
The temperature of the kettle and the rate of cooling are controlled by both computers and technicians,Relevant
This step is performed in a special room or area designed to control the hazards of fire and explosion,Irrelevant
Most modern factories perform this step in an area with walls that will close in if an alarm sounds and in the event of explosion with ceilings that will safely blow off without endangering the rest of the structure,Irrelevant
Materials are mixed in computerized closed kettles,Relevant
At the end of the process the mix is cooled slightly before the addition of such other materials as perfumes and moisturizers,Relevant
The mixture is then pumped into smaller 55 gallon drums and then trucked to a production line,Relevant
The finished nail polish is pumped into explosion proof pumps and then into smaller bottles suitable for the retail market,Relevant
In the workroom an operator first spreads the 40 yard bolts of cloth on a long cutting table,Relevant
Cutting the outer fabric is done by a skilled hand to maximize the yield or the number of ties cut from the piece of goods,Irrelevant
If the fabric has a random design the operator stacks between 24 and 72 plies of fabric pieces in preparation for cutting the fabric,Irrelevant
If pattern of the fabric or of the goods consists of panels such as stripes with a medallion at the bottom these panels are then stacked according to the pattern,Irrelevant
Using the chain stitch of a sewing machine sewing operators join the tie s three sections on the bias in the neckband area,Relevant
The operator now adds the facing or tipping an extra piece of silk nylon rayon or polyester to the back of the tie s ends,Relevant
Facing gives a crisp luxurious hand to the shell,Irrelevant
Two types of facing are currently utilized,Irrelevant
Three quarter facing extends six to eight inches upward from the point of the tie while full facing extends even higher ending just under the knot,Irrelevant
A quarter to a half of an inch of the shell of the fabric is now turned under to form a point,Irrelevant
The point is then machine hemmed by the sewing operator,Relevant
Quality silk ties are pocket or piece pressed,Relevant
This means that the joint at the neck the piecing is pressed flat so the wearer will not be inconvenienced by any bulkiness,Relevant
The interlining is slip stitched to the outer shell with resilient nylon thread which runs through the middle of the tie,Relevant
Most ties are slip stitched with a Liba machine a semi automated machine that closely duplicates the look and resiliency of hand stitching,Relevant
Hand stitching is often used in the manufacture of high quality neckties because it offers maximum resiliency and draping qualities,Irrelevant
The technique is characterized by the irregularly spaced stitches on the reverse of the tie when the seam is spread slightly apart by the dangling loose thread with a tiny knot at the end of the reverse of the front apron and by the ease with which the tie can slide up and down this thread,Irrelevant
Using a turning machine or a manual turner with a rod about 9 1 2 inches long an operator turns the tie right side out by pulling one end of the tie through the other,Relevant
While not yet pressed the tie is almost complete,Irrelevant
On silk ties only the lining is then tucked by hand into the bottom corner of the long end of the tie,Relevant
If necessary the operator hand trims the lining to fit the point of the long end,Relevant
In all other ties the lining does not reach all the way to the bottom corner ,Irrelevant
A final piece to be sewn on is the loop which serves both as a holder for the thin end of the tie when it s being worn and as the manufacturer s label,Relevant
Both the core and the cladding of an optical fiber are made of highly purified silica glass,Irrelevant
An optical fiber is manufactured from silicon dioxide by either of two methods,Relevant
The first the crucible method in which powdered silica is melted produces fatter multimode fibers suitable for short distance transmission of many light wave signals,Irrelevant
The second the vapor deposition process creates a solid cylinder of core and cladding material that is then heated and drawn into a thinner single mode fiber for long distance communication,Irrelevant
There are three types of vapor deposition techniques Outer Vapor Phase Deposition Vapor Phase Axial Deposition and Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition MCVD ,Irrelevant
This section will focus on the MCVD process the most common manufacturing technique now in use,Irrelevant
MCVD yields a low loss fiber well suited for long distance cables,Irrelevant
First a cylindrical preform is made by depositing layers of specially formulated silicon dioxide on the inside surface of a hollow substrate rod,Relevant
The layers are deposited by applying a gaseous stream of pure oxygen to the substrate rod,Relevant
Various chemical vapors such as silicon tetrachloride SiCl4germanium tetrachloride GeCl4and phosphorous oxychloride POC13are added to the stream of oxygen,Relevant
As the oxygen contacts the hot surface of the roda flame underneath the rod keeps the walls of the rod very hotsilicon dioxide of high purity is formed,Relevant
The result is a glassy soot several layers thick deposited inside the rod,Relevant
This soot will become the core,Relevant
The properties of these layers of soot can be altered depending on the types of chemical vapors used,Irrelevant
After the soot is built up to the desired thickness the substrate rod is moved through other heating steps to drive out anymoisture and bubbles trapped in the soot layers,Relevant
During heating the substrate rod and internal soot layers solidify to form the boule or preform of highly pure silicon dioxide,Relevant
A preform usually measures 10 to 25 millimeters 39 to 98 inch in diameter and 600 to 1000 millimeters 23 6 to 39 37 inches in length,Irrelevant
The solid preform is then automatically transferred to a vertical fiber drawing system,Relevant
The machines that make up a typical vertical drawing system can be two stories high and are able to produce continuous fibers up to 300 kilometers 186 miles long,Irrelevant
This system consists of a furnace to melt the end of the preform sensors to monitor the diameter of the fiber being pulled from the preform and coating devices to apply protective layers over the outer cladding,Relevant
The preform first passes through a furnace where it is heated to about 3600 degrees Fahrenheit about 2000 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Next a drop of molten glass called a gob forms at the end of the preform much like a droplet of water that collects at the bottom of a leaky faucet,Relevant
The gob then falls away and the single optical fiber inside is drawn out of the preform,Relevant
As the optical fiber is pulled from the preform the material in the original substrate rod forms the cladding and the silicon dioxide deposited as soot forms the core of the optical fiber,Irrelevant
As the fiber is drawn out measuring devices monitor its diameter and its concentricity while another device applies a protective coating,Relevant
The fiber then passes through a curing furnace and another measuring device that monitors diameter before being wound on a spool,Relevant
Pigment manufacturers send bags of fine grain pigments to paint plants,Relevant
There the pigment is premixed with resin a wetting agent that assists in moistening the pigment one or more solvents and additives to form a paste,Relevant
The paste mixture for most industrial and some consumer paints is now routed into a sand mill a large cylinder that agitates tiny particles of sand or silica to grind the pigment particles making them smaller and dispersing them throughout the mixture,Relevant
The mixture is then filtered to remove the sand particles,Relevant
Instead of being processed in sand mills up to 90 percent of the water based latex paints designed for use by individual homeowners are instead processed in a high speed dispersion tank,Relevant
There the premixed paste is subjected to high speed agitation by a circular toothed blade attached to a rotating shaft,Relevant
This process blends the pigment into the solvent,Relevant
Whether created by a sand mill or a dispersion tank the paste must now be thinned to produce the final product,Relevant
Transferred to large kettles it is agitated with the proper amount of solvent for the type of paint desired,Relevant
The finished paint product is then pumped into the canning room,Relevant
For the standard 8 pint 3 78 liter paint can available to consumers empty cans are first rolled horizontally onto labels then set upright so that the paint can be pumped into them,Irrelevant
A machine places lids onto the filled cans and a second machine presses on the lids to seal them,Relevant
From wire that is fed into it from coils a bailometer cuts and shapes the handles before hooking them into holes precut in the cans,Relevant
A certain number of cans usually four are then boxed and stacked before being sent to the warehouse,Relevant
Nylon yarn is made in a process known asmelt spinning,Irrelevant
First the chemicals involvedadipic acid and hexamethylene diaminemust be polymerized to form a thick resin that is then cut into chips or pellets,Relevant
These pellets are then heated and pressurized in an autoclave into a syrupy solution,Relevant
Next the solution is extruded through a spinnereta device that looks and works like a shower head with long strings of nylon solution coming out of the holes in the device,Relevant
The number of holes depends on the type of yarn desired one hole produces monofilament yarn which is very thin and sheer several holes produce multifilament yarn which is denser and less sheer,Irrelevant
As the fibers emerge from the spinneret they are cooled by air and then stretched over rollers to stabilize the molecular chains and strengthen the fibers,Relevant
The yarn is then wound on spools,Relevant
Yarn is fed into a circular knitting machine which converts it into a series of loops,Relevant
Usually computer controlled the machine contains 300 to 420 needles and rotates at speeds up to 1 200 RPM it takes about 90 seconds to knit a full length stocking leg,Irrelevant
Next openings at the toes are seamed together and two stocking legs are seamed together to form pantyhose,Relevant
Sometimes they are seamed together with a crotch,Relevant
Like the other steps in pantyhose manufacture seaming is almost completely automated,Irrelevant
The sewn product then goes to a dye machine where it will be dyed to one of more than 100 different shades,Irrelevant
The dye machine can color about 3 500 dozen pairs a day,Irrelevant
Once dyed the pantyhose are taken to a compartment dryer which dries them,Relevant
This next step boarding is sometimes done before the dyeing process depending on the desired final product,Irrelevant
Boarding is the process of placing the pantyhose over leg forms where they are steamed and heated to the desired shape,Irrelevant
With less expensive hosiery this step may be completely bypassed and the pantyhose packaged in their relaxed state,Irrelevant
Throughout the manufacturing process quality checks are performed on the pantyhose,Relevant
A statistical method is used for inspection,Irrelevant
Pantyhose that meet the inspection guidelines are packaged in a box or paperboard envelope either manually or automatically,Relevant
After they leave the manufacturing plant the pantyhose are stored in warehouses and organized according to size style and color for efficient order filling,Relevant
Customer orders are filled by personnel at various picking stations positioned alongside a conveyor belt that carries the filled cases to a staging area for final shipping to retail markets,Relevant
Peanuts are planted in April or May depending upon the climate,Relevant
The peanut emerges as a plant followed by a yellow flower,Irrelevant
After blooming and then wilting the flower bends over and penetrates the soil,Irrelevant
The peanut is formed underground,Relevant
Peanuts are harvested beginning in late August but mostly in September and October during clear weather when the soil is dry enough so it will not adhere to the stems and pods,Relevant
The peanuts are removed from vines by portable mechanical pickers and transported to a peanut sheller for mechanical drying,Relevant
Peanuts from the pickers are delivered to warehouses for cleaning,Relevant
Blowers remove dust sand vines stems leaves and empty shells,Relevant
Screens magnets and size graders remove trash metal rocks and clods,Relevant
After the cleaning process the peanuts weigh 10 to 20 percent less,Irrelevant
The raw cleaned peanuts are stored unshelled in silos or warehouses,Relevant
Shelling consists of removing the shell or hull of peanuts with the least damage to the seed or kemels,Irrelevant
The moisture of theunshelled peanuts is adjusted to avoid excessive brittleness of the shells and kernels and to reduce the amount of dust in the plant,Relevant
The size graded peanuts are passed between a series of rollers adjusted to the variety size and condition of the peanuts where the peanuts are cracked,Relevant
The cracked peanuts then repeatedly pass over screens sleeves blowers magnets and destoners where they are shaken gently tumbled and air blown until all the shells and other foreign material rocks mudballs metal shrivels are removed,Irrelevant
The shelled peanuts are graded for size in a size grader,Relevant
The peanuts are lifted and then oriented on the perforations of the size grader,Relevant
The larger peanuts the overs are sent to one trough while the troughs are guided towards another trough,Relevant
The peanuts are then graded for color defects spots and broken skins,Relevant
The peanuts are shipped in large bulk containers or sacks to peanut butter manufacturers,Relevant
Inedible peanuts are diverted as oil stock in semibulk form ,Irrelevant
To ensure proper size and grading the truckloads transporting peanuts to peanut manufacturers are sampled mechanically,Irrelevant
The sampler testing two truckloads simultaneously can quickly and accurately assess size and grading by examining 10 samples per truckload,Irrelevant
If edible peanuts need to be stored for more than 60 days they are placed in refrigerated storage at 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit 2 to 6 degrees Celsius where they may be held for as long as 25 months,Irrelevant
Shelled the remaining peanuts weigh 30 to 60 percent less occupy 60 to 70 percent less space and have a shelf life about 60 to 75 percent shorter than unshelled peanuts,Irrelevant
The peanut butter manufacturers first dry roast the peanuts,Irrelevant
Dry roastingis done by either the batch or continuous method,Irrelevant
In the batch method peanuts are roasted in 400 pound lots in a revolving oven heated to about 800 degrees Fahrenheit 426 6 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
The peanuts are heated at 320 degrees Fahrenheit 160 degrees Celsius and held at this temperature for 40 to 60 minutes to reach the exact degree of doneness,Relevant
All the nuts in each batch must be uniformly roasted,Relevant
Large manufacturers prefer the continuous method in which peanuts are fed from the hopper roasted cooled ground into peanut butter and stabilized in one operation,Relevant
This method is less labor intensive creates a more uniform roasting and decreases spillage,Irrelevant
Still some operators believe that the best commercial peanut butter is obtained by using the batch method,Irrelevant
Since peanut butter may call for a blending of peanuts the batch method allows for the different varieties to be roasted separately,Relevant
Furthermore since peanuts frequently come in lots of different moisture content which may need special attention during roasting the batch method can also meet these needs readily,Irrelevant
The steps outlined below apply to peanut butter manufacturing that uses the batch method of roasting,Irrelevant
A photometer indicates when the cooking is complete,Relevant
At the exact time cooking is completed the roasted peanuts are removed from heat as quickly as possible in order to stop cooking and produce a uniform product,Relevant
The hot peanuts then pass from the roaster directly to a perforated metal cylinder or blower cooler vat where a large volume of air is pulled through the mass by suction fans,Relevant
The peanuts are brought to a temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit 30 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Once cooled the peanuts pass through a gravity separator that removes foreign materials,Relevant
The skins or seed coats are now removed with either heat or water,Relevant
The heat blanching method has the advantage of removing the hearts of the peanuts which contain a bitter principle,Irrelevant
Heat blanching Depending on the variety and degree of doneness desired the peanuts are exposed to a temperature of 280 degrees Fahrenheit 137 7 degrees Celsius for up to 20 minutes to loosen and crack the skins,Irrelevant
After cooling the peanuts are passed through the blancher in a continuous stream and subjected to a thorough but gentle rubbing between brushes or ribbed rubber belting,Relevant
The skins are rubbed off blown into porous bags and the hearts are separated by screening,Relevant
Water blanching Anewer process than heat blanching water blanching was introduced in 1949,Irrelevant
While the kernels are not heated to destroy natural antioxidants drying is necessary in this process and the hearts are retained,Irrelevant
The first step is to arrange the kernels in troughs then roll them between sharp stationary blades to slit the skins on opposite sides,Irrelevant
The skins are removed as a spiral conveyor carries the kernels through a one minute scalding water bath and then under an oscillating canvas covered pad which rubs off their skins,Relevant
The blanched kernels are then dried for at least six hours by a current of 120 degrees Fahrenheit 48 8 degrees Celsius air,Relevant
The blanched nuts are mechanically screened and inspected on a conveyor belt to remove scorched and rotten nuts or other undesirable matter,Relevant
Light nuts are removed by blowers discolored nuts by a high speed electric color sorter and metal parts by magnets,Relevant
Most of the devices used for grinding peanuts into butter are built so they can be adjusted over a wide rangepermitting the variation in the quantity of peanuts ground per hour the fineness of the product and the amount of oil freed from the peanuts,Irrelevant
Most grinding mills also have an automatic feed for peanuts and salt and are easy to clean,Irrelevant
To prevent overheating grinding mills are cooled by a water jacket,Relevant
Peanut butter is usually made by two grinding operations,Relevant
The first reduces the nuts to a medium grind and the second to a fine smooth texture,Relevant
For fine grinding clearance between plates is about 032 inch 08 centimeter ,Irrelevant
The second milling uses a very high speed comminutor that has a combination cutting shearing and attrition action and operates at 9600 rpm,Relevant
This milling produces a very fine particle with a maximum size of less than 0 01 inch 025 centimeter ,Irrelevant
To make chunky peanut butter peanut pieces approximately the size of one eighth of a kernel are mixed with regular peanut butter or incomplete grinding is used by removing a rib from the grinder,Relevant
At the same time the peanuts are fed into the grinder to be milled about 2 percent salt dextrose and hydrogenated oil stabilizer are fed into the grinder in a continuous horizontal operation with about plus or minus 2 percent accuracy and are thoroughly dispersed,Relevant
Peanuts are kept under constant pressure from the start to the finish of the grinding process to assure uniform grinding and to protect the product from air bubbles,Relevant
A heavy screw feeds the peanuts into the grinder,Relevant
This screw may also deliver the deaerated peanut butter into containers in a continuous stream under even pressure,Relevant
From the grinder the peanut butter goes to astainless steelhopper which serves as an intermediate mixing and storage point,Irrelevant
The stabilized peanut butter is cooled in this rotating refrigerated cylinder called avotator from 170 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit 76 6 to 48 8 degrees Celsius or less before it is packaged,Relevant
The stabilized peanut butter is automatically packed in jars capped and labeled,Relevant
Since proper packaging is the main factor in reducing oxidation without oxygen no oxidation can occur manufacturers use vacuum packing,Irrelevant
After it is put into final containers the peanut butter is allowed to remain undisturbed until crystallization throughout the mass is completed,Relevant
Jars are then placed in cartons and placed in product storage until ready to be shipped out to retail or institutional customers,Relevant
Now that most commercially used graphite is made in factories rather than mined manufacturers are able to easily control its density,Irrelevant
The graphite is mixed with clay according to the type of pencil being madethe more graphite used the softer the pencil and the darker its line,Relevant
For colored pencils pigments are added to the clay and virtually no graphite is used,Relevant
Two methods are used to form the graphite into its finished state,Irrelevant
The first is an extrusion method in which the graphite and wax mixture is forced through a mold to create a spaghetti like string which is then cut to precise measurements and dried in ovens,Relevant
In the second method the graphite and clay mixture is poured into a machine called abillet press,Relevant
A plug is placed over the top of the press and a metal ram ascends from the bottom to squash the mixture into a hard solid cylinder called a billet,Relevant
The billet is then removed from the top of the machine and placed into an extrusion press that forces it through a mold slicing off strips thesize of the pencil core ,Relevant
After being cut to size the cores pass along a conveyor belt and are collected in a trough to await insertion in the pencil wood ,Relevant
The cedar usually arrives at the factory already dried stained and waxed to prevent warping ,Relevant
Logs are then sawed into narrow strips called slats these are about 725 inches 18 4 centimeters long 25 inch 635 centimeter thick and 2 75 inches 6 98 centimeters wide,Relevant
The slats are placed into a feeder and dropped one by one onto a conveyor belt which moves them along at a constant rate,Relevant
The slats are then planed to give them a flat surface,Relevant
Next they pass under a cutter head that makes parallel semicircular groovesone half as deep as the graphite is thickalong the length of one side of each slat,Relevant
Continuing along the conveyor belt half of the slats are coated with a layer of glue and the cut graphite is laid in the grooves of these slats,Relevant
The slats without glueand without graphite in the groovesare placed on another belt that carries them to a machine that picks them up and turns them over so they are laying on the belt with the grooves facing down,Relevant
The two conveyor belts then meet and each unglued slat is placed over a slat with glue and graphite forming a sandwich,Relevant
After the sandwiches have been removed from the conveyor belt they are placed into a metal clamp and squeezed by a hydraulic press and left clamped together until the glue is dried,Relevant
When the pencils are dried the ends are trimmed to remove excess glue,Relevant
The next step is shaping when the sandwiches actually become pencils,Relevant
The sandwiches are placed on a conveyor belt and moved through two sets of cutters one above and one below the belt,Relevant
The cutters above the sandwiches cut around the top half while the lower set cuts around the bottom half and separates the finished pencils,Relevant
The majority of pencils are hexagonal so designed to keep the pencils from rolling off surfaces a single sandwich yields six to nine hexagonal pencils,Irrelevant
After the pencils have been cut their surfaces are smoothed by sanders and varnish is applied and dried,Relevant
This is done with varnishing machines in which the pencils are immersed in a vat of varnish and then passed through a felt disk which removes the excess varnish,Relevant
After drying the pencils are put through the process again and again until the desired color is achieved,Relevant
Finally the pencils receive a finishing coat,Relevant
The pencils once again are sent on a conveyor belt through shaping machines which remove any excess varnish that has accumulated on the ends of the pencils,Relevant
This step also ensures that all of the pencils are the same length,Relevant
Erasers are then attached held to the pencil by a round metal case called a ferrule,Relevant
The ferrule first attaches to the pencil either with glue or with small metal prongs and then the eraser is inserted and the ferrule clamped around it In the final step a heated steel die presses the company logo onto each pencil ,Relevant
Manufacturing a pesticide involves at least three separate activities,Irrelevant
The active ingredient is first synthesized in a chemical factory then formulated in the same place or sent to a formulator who prepares the liquid or powder form,Relevant
The pesticide is then sent to the farmer or other certified applicator who dilutes it before applying it to the fields,Relevant
When a new pesticide is first developed it is manufactured on a small scale in a laboratory,Relevant
If the substance proves viable production begins in the factory,Relevant
Batch or continuous manufacturing insures a high volume perhaps as much as 500 kilograms per cycle,Irrelevant
Synthesizing a pesticide is a complex chemical procedure that requires trained chemists and a large sophisticated laboratory,Irrelevant
The basic procedure entails altering an organic molecule to form a pesticide,Irrelevant
This may involve any of a number of specific reagents and catalysts and often must take place in a controlled climate within a certain temperature range for example ,Irrelevant
Once synthesized the active ingredient is packaged and sent to a formulator,Relevant
Liquid insecticides can be shipped in tank trucks or 200 liter drums,Irrelevant
Transport of the active ingredient follows all regulations for hazardous materials transportation,Irrelevant
A formulator accepts the active ingredient measures out the proper amount mixes it with carrier if it is to be a liquid pesticide or with inert powders or dry fertilizers if it is to be a dust pesticide then bottles or packages it,Relevant
Liquid pesticides are packaged in 200 liter drums if a large scale farmer is the anticipated customer or 20 liter jugs for small scale operations,Relevant
Dry formulations can be packaged in 5 to 10 kilogram plastic or plastic lined bags,Relevant
An emulsified formulation is usually concentrated to render transport easier the active ingredient typically makes up 50 percent of the emulsified concentrate but granulated and dry pesticides are ready to use,Relevant
The pesticide might be stored a short time before it is requested,Relevant
When it is ready for transport the estimated necessary amount is sent to the farmer who dilutes the emulsified concentrate to create the amount of pesticide desired,Relevant
In most instances the final product consists of only ,Irrelevant
5 to 1 percent of the original active ingredient,Irrelevant
The pesticide is now ready to be applied,Relevant
There are several ways to apply a pesticide,Irrelevant
The method with which Americans are most familiar is crop dusting though its use is generally limited to large flat areas,Irrelevant
A plane loaded with 2000 liter or larger tanks flies over a field and sprays out the pesticide from booms,Relevant
Booms are long horizontal rods from which several sprinklers spray down,Irrelevant
Another method is to attach the tanks and booms to a tractor and spray closer to the ground,Relevant
For small farmers the most economical method of spraying is to use one or more workers with hand held sprayers attached to small tanks,Irrelevant
A hand pump can be carried on the shoulder its tank capacity is only about 3 to 12 liters,Irrelevant
Small tanks with a capacity of around 200 liters are also used,Relevant
The pesticides are applied with a hand gun,Relevant
A rough estimate of the amount applied is 150 to 300 liters per hectare,Irrelevant
After the raw materials are selected and the desired amounts weighed they go through a series of preparation steps,Irrelevant
First they are crushed and purified,Relevant
Next they are mixed together before being subjected to one of four forming processessoft plastic forming stiff plastic forming pressing or casting the choice depends upon the type of ware being produced,Relevant
After the porcelain has been formed it is subjected to a final purification process bisque firing before being glazed,Relevant
Glaze is a layer of decorative glass applied to and fired onto a ceramic body,Relevant
The final manufacturing phase is firing a heating step that takes place in a type of oven called akiln,Irrelevant
First the raw material particles are reduced to the desired size which involves using a variety of equipment during several crushing and grinding steps,Relevant
Primary crushing is done in jaw crushers which use swinging metal jaws,Relevant
Secondary crushing reduces particles to 0 1 inch 25 centimeter or less in diameter by using mullers steel tired wheels or hammer mills rapidly moving steel hammers,Relevant
For fine grinding craftspeople use ball mills that consist of large rotating cylinders partially filled with steel or ceramic grinding media of spherical shape,Relevant
The ingredients are passed through a series of screens to remove any under or over sized materials,Relevant
Screens usually operated in a sloped position are vibrated mechanically or electromechanically to improve flow,Relevant
If the body is to be formed wet the ingredients are then combined with water to produce the desired consistency,Relevant
Magnetic filtration is then used to remove iron from the slurries as these watery mixtures of insoluble material are called,Relevant
Because iron occurs so pervasively in most clays and will impart an undesirable reddish hue to the body if it oxidizes removing it prior to firing is essential,Irrelevant
If the body is to be formed dry shell mixers ribbon mixers or intensive mixers are typically used,Irrelevant
Next the body of the porcelain is formed,Relevant
This can be done using one of four methods depending on the type of ware being produced soft plastic forming where the clay is shaped by manual molding wheel throwing jiggering or ram pressing,Irrelevant
In wheel throwing a potter places the desired amount of body on a wheel and shapes it while the wheel turns,Relevant
In jiggering the clay is put on a horizontal plaster mold of the desired shape that mold shapes one side of the clay while a heated die is brought down from above to shape the other side,Relevant
In ram pressing the clay is put between two plaster molds which shape it while forcing the water out,Relevant
The mold is then separated by applying vacuum to the upper half of the mold and pressure to the lower half of the mold,Relevant
Pressure is then applied to the upper half to free the formed body stiff plastic forming which is used to shape less plastic bodies,Relevant
The body is forced through a steel die to produce a column of uniform girth,Relevant
This is either cut into the desired length or used as a blank for other forming operations pressing which is used to compact and shape dry bodies in a rigid die or flexible mold,Relevant
There are several types of pressing based on the direction of pressure,Irrelevant
Uniaxial pressing describes the process of applying pressure from only one direction whereas isostatic pressing entails applying pressure equally from all sides slip casting in which a slurry is poured into a porous mold,Irrelevant
The liquid is filtered out through the mold leaving a layer of solid porcelain body,Relevant
Water continues to drain out of the cast layer until the layer becomes rigid and can be removed from the mold,Relevant
If the excess fluid is not drained from the mold and the entire material is allowed to solidify the process is known assolid casting,Irrelevant
After being formed the porcelain parts are generally bisque fired which entails heating them at a relatively low temperature to vaporize volatile contaminants and minimize shrinkage during firing,Relevant
After the raw materials for the glaze have been ground they are mixed with water,Relevant
Like the body slurry the glaze slurry is screened and passed through magnetic filters to remove contaminants,Relevant
It is then applied to the ware by means of painting pouring dipping or spraying,Relevant
Different types of glazes can be produced by varying the proportions of the constituent ingredients such as alumina silica and calcia,Irrelevant
For example increasing the alumina and decreasing the silica produces a matte glaze,Irrelevant
Firing is a further heating step that can be done in one of two types of oven or kiln,Irrelevant
A periodic kiln consists of a single refractory lined sealed chamber with burner ports and flues or electric heating elements ,Irrelevant
It can fire only one batch of ware at a time but it is more flexible since the firing cycle can be adjusted for each product,Irrelevant
A tunnel kiln is a refractory chamber several hundred feet or more in length,Irrelevant
It maintains certain temperature zones continuously with the ware being pushed from one zone to another,Irrelevant
Typically the ware will enter a preheating zone and move through a central firing zone before leaving the kiln via a cooling zone,Irrelevant
This type of kiln is usually more economical and energy efficient than a periodic kiln,Irrelevant
During the firing process a variety of reactions take place,Irrelevant
First carbon based impurities burn out chemical water evolves at 215 to 395 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 to 200 degrees Celsius and carbonates and sulfates begin to decompose at 755 to 1 295 degrees Fahrenheit or 400 to 700 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Gases are produced that must escape from the ware,Relevant
On further heating some of the minerals break down into other phases and the fluxes present feldspar and flint react with the decomposing minerals to form liquid glasses at 1 295 to 2 015 degrees Fahrenheit or 700 to 1 100 degrees Celsius ,Irrelevant
These glass phases are necessary for shrinking and bonding the grains,Irrelevant
After the desired density is achieved greater than 2 195 degrees Fahrenheit or 1 200 degrees Celsius the ware is cooled which causes the liquid glass to solidify thereby forming a strong bond between the remaining crystalline grains,Relevant
After cooling the porcelain is complete,Relevant
At the printing plant the process begins with the delivery of paper for stamps with the glue already applied to the back,Relevant
Two printing processes are most often used in making stamps the intaglio process which includes the gravure process and the offset process,Irrelevant
It is not unusual however for a particular stamp s specifications to call for the use of both methods,Irrelevant
Intaglio perhaps the oldest means of producing stamps is also the most time consuming,Irrelevant
However because this method creates stamps with more distinct images the process has not been pushed aside by newer faster and less expensive methods,Irrelevant
Intaglio involves engraving scratching or etching an image onto a printing plate which in turn transfers that image onto paper,Irrelevant
In one well known intaglio process calledgravure the image is first transferred onto the plate photographically and then etched into the plate,Irrelevant
This section however will focus on an engraving process,Irrelevant
The engraving method of intaglio begins with the creation of a master die in which the design of the stamp is engraved in reverse,Relevant
The design is in the lowered portion of the diethe raised portion of the die will not be reproduced in the final product,Irrelevant
This is an exacting hand process in which the engraver is carefully cutting a mirror image of the original drawing for the stamp,Relevant
It might be several weeks before the engraver is satisfied that he or she has created the perfect duplicate,Irrelevant
After the die has been completed it is heated to harden the engraved image,Relevant
In the next step the hardened intaglio is transferred to a transfer roll which consists of soft steel wrapped around a rod shaped carrier or mandrel and which resembles a shortened rolling pin,Relevant
The transfer roll is machine pressed against the master die and rocked back and forth until the master die has created a relief impression on the transfer roll,Relevant
At this point the relief is a positive impression no longer in reverse ,Irrelevant
The process is repeated until the desired number of reliefs has been created on the transfer roll,Relevant
Like the master die the transfer roll is hardened by heating,Relevant
It is then pressed against a printing plate leaving another relief again in reverse on the printing plate,Relevant
If there are several reliefs on a transfer roll all can be passed to the printing plate,Irrelevant
Several printing plates can be made from the same transfer roll if the decision is made to use more than one machine to produce a particular stamp,Irrelevant
The impression on the plate is in the form of grooves rather than a raised image,Irrelevant
Once the plate is ready for use it is fastened into the printing press and coated with ink,Relevant
Inking is done automatically by several processes including spraying ink through small jets or moving an ink covered roller across a plate,Relevant
The plate is then wiped by a blade called thedoctor blade leaving ink only in the grooves,Relevant
The plate then presses against the paper leaving a positive impression of the reverse image that was originally copied onto the master die,Relevant
If more than one color is involved separate colors are handled by a process known asselective inking,Relevant
Aparticular color of ink is applied by a piece of hard rubber that comes in contact with only the section of the stamp that is to receive that color,Relevant
After the ink is applied in one area another piece of rubber with another color for another area is used to ink another portion of the plate,Relevant
The offset method of printing is less expensive than intaglio and can also produce very fine results and it is a common choice for many stamps,Irrelevant
In this method a picture or design is first made photochemically on an aluminum plate,Relevant
Once attached to the printing press the plate is alternately bathed in ink and water the photochemical image gets ink while the non image parts are dampened with water which acts as a repellent to the ink and ensures that only the image will be transferred to the paper,Relevant
Next the plate presses against a rubber blanket which carries a reverse image of the final picture,Relevant
In turn the rubber blanket contacts the paper producing the final positive image,Relevant
Perforations can be made either during the printing process by an adjacent machine or less commonly by a separate machine afterwards,Relevant
In the first method the sheet of paper is passed through a machine which uses little pins to punch the perforation holes through the paper in a horizontal and vertical grid,Relevant
After pushing through the paper the pins meet a matching metal indentation on the other side,Relevant
After being perforated the stamps move out of the press,Relevant
In the other method of producing perforations calledrouletting a wheel similar to a pizza cutter but with pins is rolled across one side of the stamped paper after it has been removed from the printing press laying down a row of holes,Relevant
Though originally a hand operation this method of perforation is now automated,Relevant
The Bourdon tube is the most important part of the instrument,Irrelevant
The tube may be made from solid bar stock by drilling the length to the desired inside diameter and turning the outside diameter on a lathe to achieve the appropriate wall thickness,Irrelevant
However most general purpose gauges utilize preformed tubing purchased from a metals supplier,Irrelevant
The gauge builder specifies the desired wall thickness material configuration and diameter,Irrelevant
The supplier provides the material in 10 to 12 foot 3 to 3 65 meter lengths ready for production,Irrelevant
Most manufacturers have closely guarded proprietary rolling methods for rolling the tubing into the C shape,Irrelevant
The C shape of the tube is generally formed in an automatic rolling machine,Irrelevant
This machine contains two precision powered rollers through which the tubing passes,Irrelevant
One roller grasps the tubing end and forms the inside radius while the other provides outside pressure to maintain uniform contact with the tubing,Irrelevant
Each roller contains a groove that fits around the outside of the tubing these grooves allow the tubing to maintain its circular shape rather than being flattened,Irrelevant
In the rolling process a steel mandrela bar that guides the tubing into the rollers and helps it keep its shapeis first inserted though the free end of the tubing and positioned just before the rollers,Relevant
This lubricated mandrel is of the desired interior shape of the oval,Relevant
The tubing then passes over the mandrel and between the rollers,Relevant
One roller contains a clip that grabs the tubing as the roller turns it pulls the tubing and bends it into the C shape,Irrelevant
The same roller that grabs and bends the tubing also contains a saw blade,Irrelevant
As the roller continues turning after creating the bend the saw blade on it cuts the tubing to the proper length,Relevant
The tubing is then heat treated in ovens,Relevant
The socket is basically a block of metal that serves as a connector to the source of the pressure medium a mount for the case dial and movement and as an attachment slot for the Bourdon tube,Irrelevant
One end of the socket is threaded which allows it to be screwed into the pressure providing apparatus,Irrelevant
The socket may be cast forged extruded or machined from bar stock,Irrelevant
Most sockets are made on automated machining centers that turn drill mill and thread all in one cycle,Relevant
General machining practices apply to most socket manufacture,Relevant
Movements are geared mechanisms that contain a pinion a rotating shaft sector support plates hairspring and spacer columns,Irrelevant
The mechanism converts the somewhat linear displacement of the Bourdon tip into rotary movement as well as providing a means for calibration adjustment,Irrelevant
The pointer is fastened to the rotating shaft or pinion and sweeps across the graduated dial indicating the pressure amount,Irrelevant
Most movements are supplied to the gauge builder ready to use,Irrelevant
Many types of manufacturing processes are used to produce the movement components and the workmanship of the mechanism closely resembles a clockwork when completed,Irrelevant
The case dial and pointer may be sheet metal stampings plastic moldings or castings,Irrelevant
Stampings and moldings require little further processing but castings will require some machiningtrimming off excess material for instanceto meet the final requirements,Irrelevant
These components are painted as required and the dials are printed with the appropriate artwork,Irrelevant
Common printing practice utilizing both offset and direct methods is used,Irrelevant
The lens most commonly is a plastic part made by injection molding whereby the plastic is heated into a molten state and then poured into a mold of the desired shape,Irrelevant
The attachment feature that secures and seals the lens to the case is designed into the mold,Irrelevant
Glass lenses are still used but must be retained by a ring of some type,Irrelevant
Glass has fallen out of favor because of the safety problems of breakage,Irrelevant
After the Bourdon tube is made its closed end is attached to the socket by soldering brazing or welding,Relevant
The free end of the Bourdon tube is precisely located during this assembly operation and then sealed usually by the same means used to join the tube to the socket,Relevant
Once the Bourdon tube and socket assembly is secure the tip of the unsupported end of the C is attached to an endpiece,Relevant
This endpiece contains a small hole that connects the tip to the geared movement mechanism,Relevant
The Bourdon tip doesn t move a great distance within its pressure range typically 125 to 25 inch 31 to 63 centimeter ,Irrelevant
Understandably the greater the pressure the farther the tip moves,Relevant
The other componentsthe movement pointer and dialare then assembled onto the socket as a group,Relevant
While there are many variations in the manufacturing process that exploit the versatility of the fiber the following is a description of the procedure that is used in making regular or viscose rayon,Irrelevant
Regardless of whether wood pulp or cotton linters are used the basic raw material for making rayon must be processed in order to extract and purify the cellulose,Irrelevant
The resulting sheets of white purified cellulose are then treated to form regenerated cellulose filaments,Irrelevant
In turn these filaments are spun into yarns and eventually made into the desired fabric,Relevant
Sheets of purified cellulose are steeped in sodium hydroxide caustic soda which produces sheets of alkali cellulose,Relevant
These sheets are dried shredded into crumbs and then aged in metal containers for 2 to 3 days,Relevant
The temperature and humidity in the metal containers are carefully controlled,Relevant
After ageing the crumbs are combined and churned with liquid carbon disulfide which turns the mix into orange colored crumbs known as sodium cellulose xanthate,Relevant
The cellulose xanthate is bathed in caustic soda resulting in a viscose solution that looks and feels much like honey,Relevant
Any dyes or delusterants in the design are then added,Relevant
The syrupy solution is filtered for impurities and stored in vats to age this time between 4 and 5 days,Relevant
The viscose solution is next turned into strings of fibers,Relevant
This is done by forcing the liquid through a spinneret which works like a shower head into an acid bath,Irrelevant
If staple fiber is to be produced a large spinneret with large holes is used,Irrelevant
If filament fiber is being produced then a spinneret with smaller holes is used,Irrelevant
In the acid bath the acid coagulates and solidifies the filaments now known as regenerated cellulose filaments,Relevant
After being bathed in acid the filaments are ready to be spun into yarn,Relevant
Depending on the type of yarn desired several spinning methods can be used including Pot Spinning Spool Spinning and Continuous Spinning,Irrelevant
In Pot Spinning the filaments are first stretched under controlled tension onto a series of offsetting rollers calledgodet wheels,Relevant
This stretching reduces the diameter of the filaments and makes them more uniform in size and it also gives the filaments more strength,Irrelevant
The filaments are then put into a rapidly spinning cylinder called aTopham Box resulting in a cake like strings that stick to the sides of the Topham Box,Relevant
The strings are then washed bleached rinsed dried and wound on cones or spools,Relevant
Spool Spinning is very similar to Pot Spinning,Irrelevant
The filaments are passed through rollers and wound on spools where they are washed bleached rinsed dried and wound again on spools or cones,Relevant
In Continuous Spinning the filaments are washed bleached dried twisted and wound at the same time that they are stretched over godet wheels,Relevant
Once the fibers are sufficiently cured they are ready for post treatment chemicals and the various weaving processes necessary to produce the fabric,Relevant
The resulting fabric can then be given any of a number of finishing treatments,Relevant
These include calendaring to control smoothness fire resistance pre shrinking water resistance and wrinkle resistance,Irrelevant
Pieces of sheet metal are either welded or clinched together,Irrelevant
Clinching is a process closely resembling stapling in that the two pieces are crimped together under pressure though no additional pieces such as staples are added,Irrelevant
If the part of the cabinet is to be visible it will be welded and ground down to appear as one piece,Irrelevant
The extent to which the welding process is automated depends on the company and the number of refrigerators being produced,Irrelevant
If the sheet metal was not purchased in precoated form it is now painted,Irrelevant
Some manufacturers use spray equipment to lay a uniform coat ofpainton the metal,Irrelevant
Others dip the parts in a paint solvent mixture before heating them to bake the paint onto the surface,Irrelevant
The inner cabinet is sometimes made from sheet metal very similar to the outer shell,Irrelevant
Any seams are caulked to improve insulation and looks,Irrelevant
Some manufacturers and some models use plastic for inner liners for example the inner door is almost exclusively made from plastic today,Irrelevant
The plastic liners are vacuum formed,Relevant
In this process a thick piece of plastic slightly larger than the finished part has its outer edges clamped and is then heated,Relevant
The hot plastic is next pulled by vacuum into a mold and cooled,Relevant
After trimming the resulting part is ready for assembly,Relevant
The inner cabinet is inserted into the outer cabinet and the two are snapped together before the fixtures are inserted,Relevant
Some tubes and wires are run through the gap between the two before it is filled with insulation,Relevant
A dispensing device sometimes robotically operated sometimes a manually operated long gun inserts foam between the walls,Relevant
When heated in an oven this foam expands to add rigidity and insulation to the cabinet,Relevant
A similar process is used for the doors,Irrelevant
The refrigeration components are attached to the cabinet using screws and clips,Relevant
The tubing is soldered together and a protective coating is sprayed on the joints,Relevant
The order of this assembly varies between manufacturers and models,Relevant
The copper tubing from which the coils condensers and evaporators have separately been cut bent and soldered is then attached to the refrigerator as a unit,Relevant
The seal on the refrigerator door is created by means of magnet laden gaskets that are attached to the doors with screws,Relevant
Handles and hinges are also screwed onto the door before its hinges are screwed onto the cabinet,Relevant
Some adjustment is allowed for proper operation of the door,Relevant
Most manufacturers mix testing with manufacturing from this point on,Irrelevant
The unit is leak tested with nitrogen a safe gas that makes up about 79 percent of the air if it passes it is charged with refrigerant and subjected to further testing,Irrelevant
Next the accessories shelves crispers ice trays etc are added and taped down for shipping,Irrelevant
The unit is given a final look and then packaged for shipping,Irrelevant
The major components of most revolvers begin as a group of steel or stainless steel blanks that are forged into close approximations of the desired parts,Relevant
The basic shape of each part is formed by placing a heated blank of material into a forging press and impacting it with several hundred tons of force,Relevant
This impact forces the metal into the forging die a steel block with a cavity shaped like the part being produced,Relevant
Sometimes multiple strikes by the press are required each with a more precise die than the previous step,Relevant
The resulting part is both extremely strong and very similar to final shape,Irrelevant
After forging the flow patterns of the metal must be stabilized by heat treating,Relevant
This procedure consists of reheating the parts in a controlled atmosphere to relieve internal stresses without reducing the metal s inherent strength,Irrelevant
Machining can now begin on the frame cylinder and other component parts,Irrelevant
Most modern revolvers are manufactured on automated computer controlled machining centers and lathes,Irrelevant
However a number of manufacturers have had such excellent service and results with some of their machines that they continue to utilize fifty year old equipment,Irrelevant
Regardless of whether older or modern equipment is used the basic process actions of milling drilling and tapping are essentially the same,Irrelevant
The tolerances on this machining must be held within one or two thousandths of an inch,Irrelevant
All of the components from the screws to the trigger are machined using similar processes,Irrelevant
To effectively machine the raw forging a worker clamps it into a holding apparatus that secures the part during machining,Irrelevant
Properly designed fixtures also contain tool guides and bushings to support the cutting tool and increase accuracy,Irrelevant
Many of the operations performed will require several specialized fixtures,Irrelevant
Cylinders screws shafts and barrels are made on lathes while frames sideplates sights and triggers are made on a milling and machining center,Irrelevant
One of the most unique processes is the rifling of the barrel,Irrelevant
Rifling is essentially a series of grooves within the barrel,Irrelevant
These grooves have a precise twist that through contact with the bullet circumference causes the bullet to spin during firing,Irrelevant
This rate of twist is about 1 turn in 16 inches 40 6 centimeters ,Irrelevant
To produce the rifling a worker subjects the barrel to either the cutting or the button rifling process,Irrelevant
Cutting is accomplished by drawing a broach like cutting tool through the barrel blank repeatedly removing metal to approximately 010 inch 025 centimeter deep,Relevant
Cutting marks and other scratches within the rifling can impair accuracy by damaging the bullet which throws it out of balance,Relevant
However one advantage of these marks is that they are different in every gun barrel producing unique rifling imprints on the bullets they fire,Relevant
This is how law enforcement specialists match bullets to the gun that fired them,Irrelevant
Button rifling refers to an operation in which a hardened form tool is drawn through the barrel blank under high force displacing the metal in the grooves without cutting,Irrelevant
This is similar in some respects to the forging operation only it is done without heating the barrel,Irrelevant
The advantages of button rifling are increased production no chip formation and improved surface quality,Irrelevant
After machining the metal surfaces of most steel or aluminum weapons receive a protective coating to reduce corrosion,Irrelevant
Commonly referred to asblueing this process entails submersing the parts in tanks of acid and other chemicals,Irrelevant
In these vats the chemicals react with the metal to produce a durable barrier against the elements,Irrelevant
Chrome andgoldplating parkerizing and anodizing for aluminum are some variants of the blueing process while plating another means of applying a protective coat is accomplished by setting up an electric current between the parts and the supply anode which consists of another type of metal,Irrelevant
Theelectrical path carries molecules of the plating metal to the component where they bond very tightly to the surface,Irrelevant
The entire weapon is assembled by one person who fits all of the components many of them manually,Relevant
While dimensional control has improved significantly over the past twenty years the timing of the trigger and hand mechanism and the crispness of the trigger pull are still set by hand,Irrelevant
Most manufacturers have grades of fitting quality for example the trigger pull of a service weapon that will be used by police is set heavier than that of a target or specialty handgun,Irrelevant
One would expect to exert a more determined effort to discharge a weapon in a law enforcement setting while at the target range the lighter trigger pull is desirable to increase accuracy,Irrelevant
Once the weapon has been put together any necessary filing polishing and turning will be performed before testing,Relevant
The initial stage of manufacturing the harvested latex usually takes place on the rubber plantation prior to packing and shipping,Irrelevant
The first step in processing the latex is purification which entails straining it to remove the other constituent elements apart from rubber and to filter out impurities such as tree sap and debris,Irrelevant
The purified rubber is now collected in large vats,Relevant
Combined with acetic or formic acid the rubber particles cling together to form slabs,Relevant
Next the slabs are squeezed between rollers to remove excess water and pressed into bales or blocks usually 2 or 3 square feet 6 or 9 square meter ready for shipping to factories,Relevant
The size of the blocks depends on what the individual plantation can accommodate,Irrelevant
The rubber is then shipped to a rubber factory,Relevant
Here the slabs are machine cut or chopped into small pieces,Relevant
Next many manufacturers use a Banbury Mixer invented in 1916 by Femely H Banbury,Irrelevant
This machine mixes the rubber with other ingredientssulfur to vulcanize it pigments to color it and other chemicals to increase or diminish the elasticity of the resulting rubber bands,Relevant
Although some companies don t add these ingredients until the next stage milling the Banbury machine integrates them more thoroughly producing a more uniform product,Irrelevant
Milling the next phase of production entails heating the rubber a blended mass if it has been mixed discrete pieces if it has not and squeezing it flat in a milling machine,Relevant
After the heated flattened rubber leaves the milling machine it is cut into strips,Relevant
Still hot from the milling the strips are then fed into an extruding machine which forces the rubber out in long hollow tubes much as a meat grinder produces long strings of meat ,Relevant
Excess rubber regularly builds up around the head of each extruding machine and this rubber is cut off collected and placed back with the rubber going into the milling machine,Irrelevant
The tubes of rubber are then forced over aluminum poles calledmandrels which have been covered with talcum powder to keep the rubber from sticking,Irrelevant
Although the rubber has already been vulcanized it s rather brittle at this point and needs to be cured before it is elastic and usable,Irrelevant
To accomplish this the poles are loaded onto racks that are steamed and heated in large machines,Relevant
Removed from the poles and washed to remove the talcum powder the tubes of rubber are fed into another machine that slices them into finished rubber bands,Relevant
Rubber bands are sold by weight and because they tend to clump together only small quantities can be weighed accurately by machines,Relevant
Generally any package over 5 pounds 2 2 kilograms can be loaded by machine but will still require manual weighing and adjusting,Relevant
Shoemaking is a labor intensive process and the cost of producing the many components of the running shoe reflect the skilled labor necessary,Irrelevant
Each phase of production requires precision and skills and taking shortcuts to reduce costs can result in an inferior shoe,Irrelevant
Some running shoes known assliplasted shoes have no insole board,Irrelevant
Instead the single layer upper is wrapped around both the top and the bottom portions of the foot,Irrelevant
Most running shoes however consist of an insole board that is cemented to the upper with cement,Irrelevant
This section will focus on cement lasted shoes,Irrelevant
First prepared rolls of synthetic material and rolls of dyed split and suede leather used as part of the foxing are sent to the factory,Relevant
Next die machines stamp the shoe shapes which are then cut out in cookie cutter fashion with various markings to guide the rest of the assembly,Relevant
After being bundled and labeled these pieces are sent to another part of the factory where they ll be stitched,Relevant
The pieces that will form the upper part of the shoe are stitched or cemented together and the lace holes punched out,Relevant
These pieces include the featherline the vamp the mudguard the throat with eyestay and lacing section the tongue reinforcements such as the saddle or arch bandage the collar with Achilles tendon protector the foxing and the logo,Relevant
At this point the upper looks not like a shoe but like a round hat because there is extra materialcalled thelasting marginthat will be folded underneath the shoe when it gets cemented to the sole,Irrelevant
Next the insole is stitched to the sides of the upper,Relevant
Stiffening agents are then added to the heel region and toe box and an insole board is inserted,Relevant
The completed upper is heated and fitted around a last a plastic mold that forms the final shape of the shoe,Relevant
An automatic lasting machine then pulls the upper down over the last,Relevant
Finally a cement nozzle applies cement between the upper and insole board and the machine presses the two pieces together to bond them,Relevant
The upper now has the exact shape of the finished shoe,Irrelevant
Pre stamped and cutout forms of the midsole and outsole or wedge are layered and cemented to the upper,Irrelevant
First the outsole and midsole are aligned and bonded together,Relevant
Next the outsole and midsole are aligned with the upper and placed over a heater to reactivate the cement,Relevant
As the cement cools the upper and bottom are joined,Relevant
The shoe is removed from the last and inspected,Relevant
Any excess cement is scraped off,Relevant
After the hide or skin is removed from the animal s carcass it is soaked in drums containing lime and other chemicals to loosen the hair and outer layer of the skin,Relevant
The inside flesh layer is also removed either by machine or hand with a special knife,Relevant
The remaining hide is soaked in lime and bacteria solutions to remove residue,Relevant
Next the hair is removed either by machine or manually with a special knife,Relevant
The hide is soaked again this time in an acid solution in order to remove the lime left by the previous soakings,Relevant
Because it is important that the fleshy side is left smooth with no loose fibers the hide undergoes a final treatment called scudding which involves hanging the hide over a beam and removing any bits of remaining hair tissue and dirt with a blunt knife,Relevant
The hide is then thoroughly washed,Relevant
To prevent hides from decaying they are immersed in a diluted solution of tanning acid,Relevant
Over several months they are gradually treated with stronger solutions,Relevant
Oil tanning or chamoising is still used sometimes by rubbing animal or fish grease into the hide,Irrelevant
At this point the leather has two sides the flesh side and the grain side,Irrelevant
The hides are now given to a currier who manually rubs a mixture of tallow cod oil and other greases plus wax into the leather over a period of time,Relevant
This process gives the leather color makes it flexible durable and waterproof,Irrelevant
The most common and popular colors for saddles are golden yellow also known as the London color and Havana which is of a darker shade,Irrelevant
Warwick a much darker color that turns black with use is applied in the making of frizzing harness as opposed to riding tack,Irrelevant
This color is produced by staining with aniline dye ,Irrelevant
The currier then allows the hides to mature for several weeks,Relevant
There are two basic saddle tree designs the rigid and spring tree both of which can accommodate either a straight or dipped seat,Irrelevant
The modern English saddle usually has a spring tree while the Western saddle has a rigid tree,Irrelevant
The spring tree is first shaped out of thin plywood,Relevant
Fiberglass material the fiberglass looks like a white screen mesh is then stretched over this plywood and liquid resin is hand brushed or sprayed on top resulting in a very strong and durable product,Relevant
Two springs made of lightweight steel strips are then inserted under the tree running from front to the rear along the widest part of the seat and set about two inches five centimeters from the outside,Relevant
The springs provide greater comfort and more flexibility to the rider by allowing the pressure exerted through the seat bones to be transmitted to the horse,Irrelevant
The rigid saddle tree is made by molding it out of fiberglass by combining wood shavings with resin in a mold under pressure or by creating a wooden tree around which wet leather strips are wrapped and allowed to dry,Relevant
To reinforce the saddle tree steel plates are placed underneath the tree from the pommel the head to the cantle the rear part of the saddle which projects upward ,Relevant
The steel plates are secured above and below the pommel at the head and gullet of the tree,Relevant
The stirrup bars are attached next,Relevant
A prong line metal bracket measuring three inches wide is bolted onto the tree below the head on the point of the tree the forward most point of the saddle ,Irrelevant
Bars are made of two pieces the bar itself and a movable catch or thumb piece which is set into the bar,Irrelevant
This catch works on the premise that it can be opened when the stirrup leather is put in position and will in theory open and release the leather if the rider should fall,Irrelevant
The bars are always forged hammered or squeezed into the proper shape or cast put into a liquid state and forced into a shaped mold and the word forged or cast is always stamped on the bar,Irrelevant
A typical saddle includes a seat for the rider skirts panels and flaps that protect the horse from the rider s legs and vice versa a girth that fits around the stomach of the horse and keeps the saddle stable and stirrups for the rider s feet,Irrelevant
D rings are used to hold items such as canteens or ropes,Irrelevant
A typical saddle includes a seat for the rider skirts panels and flaps that protect the horse from the rider s legs and vice versa a girth that fits around the stomach of the horse and keeps the saddle stable and stirrups for the rider s feet,Irrelevant
The stirrup leathers about 7 8 inch 2 2 centimeters wide are made from read leather cowhide rawhide or buffalo hide,Irrelevant
They go over the top of the bar and back down to the stirrups,Irrelevant
A strong muslin cloth is placed over the tree from the pommel to the cantle to form a foundation,Relevant
Pitch paint is then applied to waterproof it,Relevant
Next strips of white serge a woolen material are stretched and fastened tightly with small nails from the head of the tree at the pommel to the cantle,Relevant
Stretch canvas is then positioned over the serge and nailed in place,Relevant
This forms the base of the seat,Irrelevant
Small pieces of shaped felt and leather called bellies are placed on the edges of the tree at the broadest part of the seat so that when the seat is eventually made it will not drop away at the edges,Relevant
A piece of serge is then tightly stretched and stitched down to the canvas layer to make the shape of the seat,Relevant
Next a small slit is made so that the space between the serge and canvas can be lightly stuffed with wool to give the seat resilience and to prevent the tree itself being felt through the leather seat,Relevant
Pigskin is now dampened and stretched tightly and is then stretched over the seat,Relevant
The pigskin is dampened and stretched so that when it dries and shrinks a neat and tight final product will be achieved ,Irrelevant
The under panel which protects the horse from the girths is stitched and nailed into place on the tree,Relevant
The under panel is usually made of pigskin leather or grained cowhide,Irrelevant
Girth straps are attached to the saddle next,Relevant
Made of soft leather these straps are very short,Irrelevant
Attached to them are the girths whose purpose is to hold the saddle firmly in place by fastening them around the horse s belly,Irrelevant
These girths are made in 7 8 inch or one inch 2 54 centimeters thick sizes and they can range in length from 36 inches 91 44 centimeters for a tiny pony to 54 inches 137 centimeters for a large horse these measurements include the buckles ,Irrelevant
Girths are made of soft leather mohair or nylon,Irrelevant
The outer panels made of leather are stuffed with felt wool or plastic foam and are covered in either leather serge or linen,Relevant
They are attached underneath the saddle,Irrelevant
Leather skirts are then sewn just above the outer panel,Relevant
D rings also known as tie downs are now attached to the saddle,Relevant
Usually about one inch wide the D rings are made of rawhide and have strings attached to them,Irrelevant
The salsa manufacturer purchases fresh frozen or dehydrated produce such astomatoes peppers and onions from growers,Irrelevant
Other ingredients such as vinegar tomato paste spices or additives are purchased from manufacturers in processed form,Irrelevant
The tomatoes are first inspected then peeled using lye,Relevant
The stems seeds and any residual skin are then removed,Relevant
Some salsa manufacturers roast their green chili peppers before washing them,Relevant
Next the stem seeds and calyx are removed,Relevant
The chili peppers are then blanched and the pH value or acid count is adjusted using citric acid,Relevant
All other produce is cleaned by passing the vegetables through tanks of water or by spraying under high water pressure,Relevant
The inedible parts of these vegetables such as garlic peel stems or onion skins are removed by processing machines,Relevant
The vegetables are then cut using standard machines that are pre set to the desired level of fineness,Relevant
To make chunky salsa the vegetables are usually diced while the fresh cilantro is minced,Relevant
To make smoother salsa all the vegetables are processed to the same consistency as the tomatoes,Relevant
Most salsa is not fresh due to long distance transport of the product from manufacturing plants to retail outlets,Irrelevant
Because it is important for the product to have a long shelf life heating the salsa is necessary to prohibit the growth of mold within the container before purchase,Relevant
Most salsa however is minimally processed,Relevant
The tomato paste or processed tomatoes water vinegar and spices are placed in a pre mix kettle that is large enough to hold several batches of salsa,Relevant
This mixture is then placed in a batch kettle along with the other ingredients such as onions and chili peppers,Relevant
Salsa may be slow or fast cooked or in the case of fresh salsa steam cooked,Relevant
Cooking time and temperature vary the slow method subjects the salsa to a low temperature of 163 degrees Fahrenheit 71 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes while the fast method subjects the salsa to a high temperature of 253 degrees Fahrenheit 121 degrees Celsius for 30 seconds under pressure,Irrelevant
After cooking the salsa is ladled into glass jars plastic bottles or other containers that are usually made from heat resistant polyethylene or polypropylene,Relevant
Fresh salsa is placed into the container cold and then steam heated while cooked salsa is placed into the container while it is still warm,Relevant
The machine that fills the containers does so by volume,Irrelevant
The jars or containers are then sealed and cooled in cold water or air,Relevant
This process vacuum seals the product because the heated salsa cools and contracts producing a partial vacuum under the seal,Relevant
Jars and plastic containers that are not preprinted with product information are labeled and then packed incorrugated cardboardboxes to be shipped to stores,Relevant
A typical sanding belt originates with the manufacture of a large roll of coated abrasive containing an X weight cotton fabric backing 100 grit aluminum oxide and resin bond,Irrelevant
Production starts when the make coat is applied to one side of the backing material,Relevant
The next step applying the abrasive mineral is the most important in the manufacturing process because it determines the orientation and density of the mineral,Relevant
In the past the backing with the first layer of adhesive passed under a controlled stream of abrasive which applied a thin layer of randomly oriented grit,Irrelevant
Today the backing is passed adhesive side down over a pan of abrasives that have been electrostatically chargedgiven an electric charge opposite to the backing,Irrelevant
The opposite charge causes the abrasive to adhere evenly to the backing resulting in a very sharp fast cutting coated abrasive tool with the maximum life possible,Irrelevant
Controlling mineral density on the flexible backing gives rise to two important variations in product design open and closed coat abrasives,Irrelevant
An open coat product contains abrasives grains that cover from 50 to 70 percent of the surface area of the backing,Irrelevant
This lower density allows the finished product to be flexible and prevents it from clogging or loading with bits of work material,Relevant
In closed coat products the mineral covers 100 percent of the available surface area making the finished products better for finishing applications and more suitable for rougher handling than open coat products,Irrelevant
Once the grain has been imbedded in the make coat the roll is dried and moved on for application of the size coat,Relevant
Following application of the size coat the roll is dried again and cured under carefully controlled temperature and humidity conditions,Relevant
Thefinished product is then wound on a large spool and shipped to the companies that will convert it into sanding belts or other items,Relevant
Additional materials and processes may be included to give the converted product special characteristics,Relevant
One such treatment is the addition of a grinding aid in the size coat that improves grinding of some metals in high pressure applications,Relevant
Another treatment entails applying a pressure sensitive adhesive to the nonabrasive side of the backing to make some types of sanding disks,Irrelevant
Material may be also added to reduce the static electricity that is generated when a belt is used on wood,Relevant
Passing the roll through two closely spaced steel rollers in a process calledsatiningcrushes protruding minerals and leaves a product with uniform thickness designed for fine finishing applications,Irrelevant
Before the coated abrasive roll is converted into a belt or other product it is systematically flexed or bent to break the continuous layer of adhesive bond,Relevant
This flexing is necessary because the freshly manufactured roll is so stiff that it otherwise would not perform properly when converted into other products,Relevant
Flexing can be applied in either a single direction or in multiple directions,Irrelevant
Single direction flexing breaks the bond usually at a 90 degree angle to the edge of the roll,Irrelevant
For special applications in which the belt must accurately conform to contours of a part surface single direction flexing is applied along lines parallel to the sides of the belt,Irrelevant
Multiple flexing breaks the bond at 45 degree angles to the sides of the belt in a criss cross pattern or in a combination of 90 degree and 45 degree directions,Irrelevant
Although the latter produces a very flexible belt such flexing greatly reduces the useful life of the product,Irrelevant
Converting roll material into abrasive belts starts with cutting strips of coated abrasives to the desired width,Relevant
Each strip is then cut to the proper length and the ends are joined together,Relevant
The joint in common belts is an overlapping splice at 45 degrees,Irrelevant
Narrow belts are spliced at a more acute angle and wide belts at a greater angle,Relevant
A variety of splicing techniques can be applied depending upon the importance of changes in belt thickness at the slice and the amount of stress the belt will receive during use,Irrelevant
One common practice in preparing a splice for joining isskiving a process that removes a layer of abrasive or backing from the ends of the belt,Irrelevant
To minimize thickness of joints in products used for finishing applications both ends are skived,Relevant
Coarse grained products which are used for less precise applications are skived on one end only,Relevant
Conversion of other products proceeds similarly,Irrelevant
For example sanding disks begin with a properly sized section of roll material and a machine punches out the individual disks complete with the hole in the center,Irrelevant
To make fiberglass suitable for dish manufacture a sheet molding compound mixture that includes reflective metallic material and ultraviolet scattering compositions is mixed with resin calcium carbonate and a catalyst cure,Relevant
This mixture forms a paste that is poured onto a sheet of polyethylene film that has fiberglass added in chopped form,Relevant
The result is a sheet layered with the compound paste fiberglass and the polyethylene film,Relevant
This sheet is then pressed at 89 degrees Fahrenheit 30 degrees Celsius to mature,Relevant
To shape the sheet into the desired parabolic shape it is pressed at high pressure of 1 400 2 200 metric tons ,Relevant
The dish is then trimmed cooled and painted,Relevant
After the paint has dried the dish is packed for shipment in sturdy boxes,Relevant
For metallic dishes the common metal of choice is aluminum,Irrelevant
This type of dish can be assembled in sections called petals or all at once,Irrelevant
An aluminum plate is perforated with a punching die creating tiny holes,Relevant
The size of these holes are contingent on the manufacturer s preference,Irrelevant
Larger holes mean greater loss of the signal so fairly small holes are selected,Relevant
Another factor in the selection of hole size is the power of the broadcasting satellite,Irrelevant
Newer more powerful satellites require a hole size that is approximately half that required for older less powerful satellites,Relevant
The newly perforated aluminum plate is then heated stretched over a mold cooled and trimmed,Relevant
A paint powder coating for protection is then applied using an electrostatic charge in which the paint is given an opposite electrical charge from the plate,Relevant
The dish or petal is then heated to melt the powder and seal the paint on,Relevant
The petals are usually sealed together with ribs in the factory,Relevant
Although some current home satellite dishes are very smallonly about 3 feet in diametermanufacturers have begun to introduce even smaller dishes that have a diameter of only 18 inches and can fit on a window sill or a porch,Irrelevant
Mesh petals are made from aluminum that is extrudedforced into a die of the proper shape,Irrelevant
They are usually joined together on site by sliding them into aluminum ribs that attach to the hub and then securing them with metal pins,Relevant
All dishes when complete will have the necessary equipment the feed horn the amplifier etc installed in the factory,Relevant
When the dish has been set up at the local dealer it is transported to the site location on a open trailer,Relevant
Satellite dishes can be installed either by professionals or by the purchaser with assistance from the retailer if necessary,Irrelevant
The method selected depends upon the size of the dish and the mechanical expertise of the purchaser,Irrelevant
An installation site reasonably clear of obstructions not more than 246 feet 75 meters from the house is selected,Relevant
Site selection is also contingent on local building codes and the possibility of microwave interference from radio and television towers in the vicinity,Relevant
Once a site is selected the base must be installed first,Relevant
The base of most satellite dishes consists of a concrete foundation that extends below the frost line,Irrelevant
A clayey soil is excellent while sandy or rocky soil requires more concrete,Irrelevant
A base tube filled with concrete is then set into the concrete foundation,Relevant
Some satellite dishes require a slab mount installation a method considered to be more stable than typical base construction,Relevant
In some cases slab mount installation is necessary since the site selected for the placement of the satellite dish is unstable,Relevant
The slab is generally 1 6 feet 5 meter square and 3 2 feet 1 meter deep,Irrelevant
Soil is excavated to the proper depth and the concrete is poured,Relevant
A triangular steel mount fixture is then embedded into the concrete,Relevant
Next the pedestal is attached to either the base tube or the triangular steel mount fixture,Relevant
The elevation arm is then attached to the pedestal,Relevant
The mounted satellite dish must be aligned in order to point toward the satellite,Relevant
The angle at which the dish is eventually situated will vary according to which satellite is selected and at what latitude the dish is located,Irrelevant
Coaxial cables connect the satellite to the receiver that is located in the house near the television,Relevant
A trench must be dug for these cables which are placed into a pipe before being buried,Irrelevant
Making a flat tip or slotted screwdriver is not very different than making any other configuration,Irrelevant
Variations between a flat tip and a Phillips screwdriver will be discussed later in this entry,Irrelevant
First coils of green wire wire that has not yet been drawn to final size are delivered to a factory in large coils some as heavy as 3 000 pounds 1 362 kilograms ,Relevant
The wire is usually about 375 inch 95 centimeter in diameter,Irrelevant
The wire is then machine drawn to the diameter necessary for the production run one adjustable drawing machine can produce any required diameter,Relevant
In drawing wire is fed through a die with a reducing aperture until it assumes the proper size,Relevant
After the wire is drawn it is annealed heat treated to obtain the correct tensile strength in the metal,Relevant
This process involves baking the wire at a temperature of about 1 350 degrees Fahrenheit 732 degrees Celsius for 12 hours,Relevant
Next the wire is straightened by a string forge and then transferred to a cold forming press which cuts the wire to the appropriate length and forms the tip of the screwdriver and the wings that will fit into the handle,Relevant
These wings can be seen through a clear or semi clear plastic handle,Irrelevant
The newly formed bar the actual screwdriver without Ats handle is then heat treated in an in line furnace at approximately 1 555 degrees Fahrenheit 846 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
This is a continuous flow process and as the bars come through the furnace they fall into an oil quench for cooling,Relevant
The bars are then placed in a draw back oven 450 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit or 232 to 259 degrees Celsius and baked to a specified hardness,Relevant
Consumer model screwdrivers are nickel platedcovered with a protective coating of nickelbefore assembly,Relevant
If the screwdriver is designated for professional use it is transferred to a hand grinding department where the tip is ground to size,Relevant
The shank is chemically milled and then polished,Relevant
The screwdriver then goes to a nickel flash bath and is electrically chrome plated,Relevant
After the cold forming press step #3 above cuts the wire the screwdriver is sent to a swage and grind operation where dies form blades for the tip from the heated wire,Relevant
The tool is then ground and the wings are formed,Relevant
If a professional model is being produced the bar goes to a tipping operation an automatic tipping machine that creates the bullet point and then to a profilator machine a machine that cuts a profile ,Irrelevant
This latter machine cuts the four grooves or slots on the sides above the point,Relevant
The wire is then winged and heat treated in the same way as the flat tip screwdriver bars,Relevant
Consumer model Phillips screwdrivers are nickel plated while the professional model is polished and nickel chrome plated,Relevant
The handles of a screwdriver are usually made of cellulose acetate it is delivered to the factory in powder form cellulose acetate rosin and then mixed with a liquid plasticizer in a giant blender that holds approximately 1 000 pounds 454 kilograms of the mixed material,Irrelevant
If a colored handle is desired pigments are added into the blender,Relevant
The resulting paste which has the consistency of thick cake batter then goes to an extruder a machine that forces a material out through an opening the way a meat grinder forces out strings of meat which extrudes a solid piece of cellulose acetate,Irrelevant
The cellulose acetate is then cut into small pellets,Relevant
Next the pellets are fed into another extruder that extrudes the materials for the handles in bars that are 8 to 10 feet 2 4 to3 meters in length,Relevant
If a two color handle is desired a second extruding machine can be attached to the first to extrude a single two color rod,Relevant
The rods are then put into an automatic turning machine which shapes the handles and cuts them to the final length,Relevant
A hole is then drilled in the handle where the bar will be inserted,Relevant
The handles are machine washed and dried to remove grease oil and excess scraps from the turning machine and the extruder,Relevant
Next the handles are immersed in an acetone vapor bath which melts and smooths the outside of the handle,Relevant
The acetone vapor is highly flammable and this process takes place inside an explosion proof room,Irrelevant
The method of final assembly depends on the quality of the tool being produced,Relevant
Professional models are assembled individually on a horizontal assembly machine that hydraulically forces the bar into the plastic handle,Relevant
The handles are branded by a hot stamp immediately before going into the assembly machine,Relevant
This assembly process requires one skilled operator for each machine,Irrelevant
Other models might be assembled on hydraulic presses three at a time,Relevant
The least expensive models are assembled six at a time on one machine and placed by robot on a skin card machine that packages the screwdrivers for mass market sale,Relevant
Before packaging the screwdrivers might be fitted with a special handle cover depending on need,Relevant
A rubber cap fitted over a screwdriver handle for example might be more comfortable for a professional using his tool five or six hours a day,Relevant
A large handle with deep grooves might be ideal for some workers while the home handyman who assembles a lamp or cabinet once every six months may not need or want to pay for the extra comfort,Relevant
A site might interest a seismologist for a number of reasons,Irrelevant
The most obvious one is that the region is earthquake prone perhaps because it is adjacent to a fault or fracture in the earth s crust,Irrelevant
Such fractures dislodge one of the blocks of earth adjoining them causing the block to shift higher lower or horizontally parallel to the fault and leaving the area vulnerable to further instability,Irrelevant
A seismograph might also be installed in a region currently without one so that seismologists can gather data for a more complete picture of the area,Irrelevant
Although some seismographs are placed in university or museum basements for educational purposes the ideal location for earthquake research would be more remote,Irrelevant
To record the earth s seismic movements more accurately a seismograph should be placed where traffic and other vibrations are minimal,Irrelevant
In some cases an unused tunnel can be appropriated,Irrelevant
Other times a natural underground cavern is available,Irrelevant
Seismological researchers may even choose to dig a well and place the instrument inside if no other underground hole exists where a seismograph is deemed desirable,Irrelevant
An above ground seismograph is also possible but it must rest above a solid rock foundation,Irrelevant
At a specialized factory the component parts of the seismograph are assembled and prepared for shipment,Relevant
First the pendulum is attached to either a soft spring if it s a vertical unit or a wire if it s a horizontal unit and suspended within a cylinder While horizontal seismometers contain a pendulum attached to a wire vertical units use a spring instead,Relevant
When the ground vibrates during an earthquake the pendulum remains still while the recorder moves thus creating a record of the earth s movement,Irrelevant
Some recorders consist of a coil that generates an electrial signal which in turn is stored in computer memory for later printing,Irrelevant
A less sophisticated seismograph will have either a mirror that shines light onto light sensitive paper a pen that writes with quick drying ink upon a roll of paper or a heat pen that marks thermal paper,Irrelevant
While horizontal seismometers contain a pendulum attached to a wire vertical units use a spring instead,Irrelevant
A less sophisticated seismograph will have either a mirror that shines light onto light sensitive paper a pen that writes with quick drying ink upon a roll of paper or a heat pen that marks thermal paper between electric coils,Irrelevant
Next the coils are wired to printed circuit boards and placed inside the seismograph body,Relevant
The whole unit can in turn be connected to a digital audio tape recorder which receives the current generated by the coils and transferred to the circuit boards,Relevant
If the data recording equipment consists of more traditional equipment such as a roll of paper and a pen these are now attached to the unit,Relevant
Depending on the final destination the seismograph is shipped by truck or plane in a cushioned crate by transporters experienced in moving delicate electronic equipment,Relevant
A seismograph intended for educational purposes might be bolted into the concrete floor of a basement but research seismographs are best situated far from the inevitable vibrations of a building,Relevant
They are either installed directly onto the bedrock in instances where great precision is required or in a bed of concrete,Relevant
In both cases earth is removed and the ground leveled,Relevant
In the second instance a bed of concrete is poured and allowed to set,Relevant
After the base has been prepared the seismometer unit is bolted into place,Relevant
In some instances where great sensitivity is required it will be housed in a vault where the temperature and humidity are controlled,Relevant
The seismometer unit is usually installed in the chosen field cavern or vault while the amplifiers filters and recording equipment are housed separately,Relevant
In modern seismology it is typical to have several seismometer units arrayed at a distance from one another,Relevant
Each seismometer unit sends signals to a central location where the data can be printed out and studied,Relevant
The signals may be broadcast from an antenna built into the unit or in more sophisticated units beamed up to a satellite,Relevant
The modern manufacture of shaving cream is a carefully controlled process,Irrelevant
Although carried out on a large scale its manufacture resembles a laboratory procedure involving only small quantities of ingredients,Irrelevant
There are two main phases to the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
In the first phase the fatty or oily portions of the formulastearic acid lanolin and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearateare heated in a jacketed kettle to a temperature of approximately 179 to 188 degrees Fahrenheit 80 to 85 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
The jacketed kettle which can hold as little as 300 gallons or as much as 10 000 gallons resembles a double boiler one container placed inside another is heated when steam is circulated through the outer container,Irrelevant
Inside the interior kettle are blades that revolve to mix the oils as they are heated,Relevant
After the first group of ingredients has turned smooth over a period of roughly 40 minutes the steam is released from the outer container of the kettle and the mixture is allowed to cool,Relevant
The second phase of manufacture begins when the mixture has cooled to about 152 degrees Fahrenheit 65 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Most of the remaining ingredientswater glycerin and triethanolamineare added now and mixing continues for approximately 40 minutes,Relevant
When the mixture reaches a temperature of 125 to 134 degrees Fahrenheit 50 to 55 degrees Celsius perfumes or other scents can be added,Relevant
Because perfumes consist primarily of highly volatile oils they would evaporate if added when the blend was still warm,Irrelevant
The formulas for perfumes which can contain more than 200 different ingredients come closer to being trade secrets than information about shaving cream itself though textbook and handbook formulas for perfume are not hard to come by ,Irrelevant
In recognition of this manufacturers do not have to disclose information about fragrances,Relevant
The mixture still being stirred is allowed to cool further until it reaches a temperature of 89 degrees Fahrenheit 30 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Now a thickening white mass of highly viscous liquid it is forced through a silk or stainless steel screen to eliminate any lumps that may have formed in the mixing process and to catch the rare impurity or foreign object such as a small wood splinter,Relevant
If this particular mixture is designated for tube packaging it is now placed in a tube and fitted with a cap,Relevant
After the bottom of the tube has been crimped the product is ready for shipment and stocking on a store shelf,Relevant
When the desired product is an aerosol spray the shaving cream is poured into an open can,Relevant
Next a valve and a cover are fitted onto the can and forced downward to form a seal,Relevant
Propellant is then forced into the can through the valve,Relevant
Most shaving preparations contain between four and five percent propellant a larger amount would dry the shaving cream as it came out of the can rendering it unusable,Irrelevant
A small amount of material is intentionally released purged to relieve excess pressure and the can is tested in water to make sure that the valve is holding tightly,Relevant
The can is now ready to be shipped,Relevant
Before the bottles can be made the PET itself must be manufactured or polymerized,Irrelevant
In polymerization smaller molecules are combined to form larger substances,Irrelevant
To make PET terephthalic acid is first combined with methanol CH 3 OH ,Relevant
This reaction yields dimethyl terephthalate and water,Relevant
Next the dimethyl terephthalat is combined with an excess of ethylene glycol at 305 degrees Fahrenheit 150 degrees Celsius to yield another substance bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate and methanol,Relevant
The final step of polymerization involves the condensation polymerization of the bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate,Relevant
In this process a polymer is formed while another molecule is released or falls out,Relevant
The condensation polymerization of bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate is carried out in a vacuum at 530 degrees Fahrenheit 275 degrees Celsius and results in chains of PET and ethylene glycol see step #1 above the latter substance is continuously removed during polymerization and used to make more PET ,Relevant
After the PET mixture reaches the required viscosity thickness it is cooled to avoid degradation and discoloration ,Relevant
Later it can be reheated for its various uses ,Irrelevant
PET beverage bottles are made using a process known as stretch blow molding also called orientation blow molding ,Irrelevant
First PET pellets are injection moldedheated and put into a moldinto a thin walled tube of plastic called a parison ,Relevant
The parison is then cooled and cut to the proper length ,Relevant
Next the parison tube is re heated and placed into another mold which is shaped like a soda bottle complete with screwtop ,Relevant
A steel rod a mandrel is slid into the parison ,Relevant
Highly pressurized air then shoots through the mandrel and fills the parison pressing it against the inside walls of the mold ,Relevant
The pressure of the air stretches the plastic both radially out and axially down ,Relevant
The combination of high temperature and stretching in the desired direction causes the molecules to polarize line up and essentially crystallize to produce a bottle of superior strength,Relevant
The entire procedure must be done quickly and the plastic must be pressed firmly against the wall or the bottle will come out misshapen,Relevant
In order to give the bottom of the bottle its proper concave shapeso that it can stand uprighta separate bottom piece is attached to the mold during the blowing process,Relevant
The mold must then be cooled,Relevant
Different cooling methods are used,Irrelevant
Water in pipes may flow around the mold or liquid carbon dioxide highly pressurized moist air or room air is shot into the bottle to cool it more directly,Irrelevant
The procedure is preferably done quickly to set the bottle before creep flow occurs,Relevant
The bottle is then removed from the mold,Relevant
In mass production small bottles are formed continuously in a string of attached bottles that are separated and trimmed,Relevant
Other trimming must be done wherever the plastic leaked through the cracks of the mold like the way pancake batter does when squeezed in a waffle maker ,Relevant
Ten to 25 percent of the plastic is lost this way but it can be reused,Irrelevant
Some soft drink producers make their own bottles but usually finished bottles are sent from specialty manufacturers to soft drink companies in trucks,Irrelevant
Plastic is cheap to transport because it is light,Irrelevant
Accessories such as lids and labels are manufactured separately,Relevant
Occasionally the plastic bottle manufacturer will put labels supplied by the soft drink company on the bottles before shipping them,Relevant
The silicon dioxide of either quartzite gravel or crushed quartz is placed into an electric arc furnace,Relevant
A carbon arc is then applied to release the oxygen,Relevant
The products are carbon dioxide and molten silicon,Irrelevant
This simple process yields silicon with one percent impurity useful in many industries but not the solar cell industry,Irrelevant
The 99 percent pure silicon is purified even further using the floating zone technique,Irrelevant
A rod of impure silicon is passed through a heated zone several times in the same direction,Relevant
This procedure drags the impurities toward one end with each pass,Relevant
At a specific point the silicon is deemed pure and the impure end is removed,Relevant
Solar cells are made from silicon boules polycrystalline structures that have the atomic structure of a single crystal,Irrelevant
The most commonly used process for creating the boule is called the Czochralski method,Irrelevant
In this process a seed crystal of silicon is dipped into melted polycrystalline silicon,Relevant
As the seed crystal is withdrawn and rotated a cylindrical ingot or boule of silicon is formed,Relevant
The ingot withdrawn is unusually pure because impurities tend to remain in the liquid,Irrelevant
From the boule silicon wafers are sliced one at a time using a circular saw whose inner diameter cuts into the rod or many at once with a multiwire saw,Relevant
A diamond saw produces cuts that are as wide as the wafer 5 millimeter thick ,Irrelevant
Only about one half of the silicon is lost from the boule to the finished circular wafermore if the wafer is then cut to be rectangular or hexagonal,Irrelevant
Rectangular or hexagonal wafers are sometimes used in solar cells because they can be fitted together perfectly thereby utilizing all available space on the front surface of the solar cell,Irrelevant
After the initial purification the silicon is further refined in a floating zone process,Relevant
In this process a silicon rod is passed through a heated zone several times which serves to drag the impurities toward one end of the rod,Relevant
The impure end can then be removed,Relevant
Next a silicon seed crystal is put into a Czochralski growth apparatus where it is dipped into melted polycrystalline silicon,Relevant
The seed crystal rotates as it is withdrawn forming a cylindrical ingot of very pure silicon,Relevant
Wafers are then sliced out of the ingot,Relevant
After the initial purification the silicon is further refined in a floating zone process,Relevant
The wafers are then polished to remove saw marks,Relevant
It has recently been found that rougher cells absorb light more effectively therefore some manufacturers have chosen not to polish the wafer ,Irrelevant
The traditional way of doping adding impurities to silicon wafers with boron and phosphorous is to introduce a small amount of boron during the Czochralski process in step #3 above,Irrelevant
The wafers are then sealed back to back and placed in a furnace to be heated to slightly below the melting point of silicon 2 570 degrees Fahrenheit or 1 410 degrees Celsius in the presence of phosphorous gas,Relevant
The phosphorous atoms burrow into the silicon which is more porous because it is close to becoming a liquid,Irrelevant
The temperature and time given to the process is carefully controlled to ensure a uniform junction of proper depth,Relevant
A more recent way of doping silicon with phosphorous is to use a small particle accelerator to shoot phosphorous ions into the ingot,Irrelevant
By controlling the speed of the ions it is possible to control their penetrating depth,Irrelevant
This new process however has generally not been accepted by commercial manufacturers,Irrelevant
Electrical contacts connect each solar cell to another and to the receiver of produced current,Relevant
The contacts must be very thin at least in the front so as not to block sunlight to the cell,Irrelevant
Metals such as palladium silver nickel or copper are vacuum evaporated This illustration shows the makeup of a typical solar cell,Irrelevant
The cells are encapsulated in ethylene vinyl acetate and placed in a metal frame that has a mylar backsheet and glass cover,Relevant
This illustration shows the makeup of a typical solar cell,Irrelevant
The cells are encapsulated in ethylene vinyl acetate and placed in a metal frame that has a mylar backsheet and glass cover through a photoresist silkscreened or merely deposited on the exposed portion of cells that have been partially covered with wax,Relevant
All three methods involve a system in which the part of the cell on which a contact is not desired is protected while the rest of the cell is exposed to the metal,Irrelevant
After the contacts are in place thin strips fingers are placed between cells,Relevant
The most commonly used strips are tin coated copper,Irrelevant
Because pure silicon is shiny it can reflect up to 35 percent of the sunlight,Irrelevant
To reduce the amount of sunlight lost an anti reflective coating is put on the silicon wafer,Relevant
The most commonly used coatings are titanium dioxide and silicon oxide though others are used,Irrelevant
The material used for coating is either heated until its molecules boil off and travel to the silicon and condense or the material undergoes sputtering,Relevant
In this process a high voltage knocks molecules off the material and deposits them onto the silicon at the opposite electrode,Relevant
Yet another method is to allow the silicon itself to react with oxygen or nitrogen containing gases to form silicon dioxide or silicon nitride,Relevant
Commercial solar cell manufacturers use silicon nitride,Irrelevant
The finished solar cells are then encapsulated that is sealed into silicon rubber or ethylene vinyl acetate,Relevant
The encapsulated solar cells are then placed into an aluminum frame that has a mylar or tedlar backsheet and a glass or plastic cover,Relevant
Each major element of the spark plugthe center electrode the side electrode the insulator and the shellis manufactured in a continuous in line assembly process,Relevant
Then the side electrode is attached to the shell and the center electrode is fitted inside the insulator,Relevant
Finally the major parts are assembled into a single unit,Relevant
The one piece spark plug shells can be made in several ways,Irrelevant
When solid steel wire is used the steel can be cold formed whereby coils of steel are formed and molded at relatively low temperatures,Relevant
Or the steel can be extruded a process in which the metal is heated and then pushed through a shaped orifice called a die to produce the proper hollow shape,Relevant
Shells can also be made from bars of steel that are fed into automatic screw machines,Relevant
These machines completely form the shell drill the hole through it and ream ita process that improves the finish of the drilled hole and makes the size of the hole more exact,Irrelevant
The formed or extruded shellscalled blanks until they re molded into their final shapesrequire secondary operations to be performed on them such as machining and knurling,Irrelevant
Knurling a shell blank involves passing it through hard patterned rollers which form a series of ridges on the outside of the blank,Relevant
Similarly machining in which machine tools cut into the exterior of the shell blankgenerates shapes and contours on the outside of the shell,Relevant
The shells are now in their final shape and are complete except for threads and side electrodes,Irrelevant
The side electrode is made of a nickel alloy wire which is fed from rolls into an electric welder straightened and welded to the shell,Relevant
It is then cut to the proper length,Relevant
Finally the side electrode is given a partial bend it is given its final bend after the rest of the plug assembly is in place,Relevant
The threads are then rolled on the shells,Relevant
Now complete the shells are usually given a permanent and protective silvery finish by an electrolytic process,Relevant
In this process the shell is placed in a solution of acids salts or alkalis and an electrical current is passed through the solution,Relevant
The result is a thin metal coating applied evenly over the shell,Irrelevant
Insulators are supplied from stock storage,Relevant
Ceramic material for the insulator in liquid form is first poured into rubber molds,Relevant
Special presses automatically apply hydraulic pressure to produce unfired insulator blanks,Relevant
The dimensions of the borethe hollow part of the insulatorinto which the center electrodes will be pressed are rigidly controlled,Irrelevant
Special contour grinding machines give the pressed insulator blanks their final exterior shape before the insulators are fired in a tunnel kiln to temperatures in excess of 2 700 degrees Fahrenheit,Relevant
The computer controlled process produces insulators that are uniformly strong dense and resistive to moisture,Irrelevant
The insulators may be fired again after identifying marks and a glaze are applied,Relevant
The nickel alloy center electrode is first electrically welded to the basic steel terminal stud a narrow metal wire that runs from the middle of the plug to the lower end the opposite end from the electrode gap ,Irrelevant
The terminal stud is attached to a nut which in turn is attached to the ignition cable that supplies the electric current to the plug,Relevant
The center electrode terminal stud assembly is sealed into the insulator and tamped under extreme pressure,Relevant
Insulator assemblies are then sealed in the metal shell under 6 000 pounds pressure,Relevant
After reaming to correct depth and angle the rim or edge of the shellcalled the flange is bent or crimped to complete a gas tight seal,Relevant
Spark plug gaskets from stock are crimped over the plug body so that they won t fall off,Relevant
To form the proper gap between the two electrodes the center electrode of the now completely assembled spark plug is machine trimmed to specifications and the ground electrode is given a final bend,Relevant
This assembly is then sealed under extreme pressure,Relevant
Finally the center electrode is machined to its exact shape and the side electrode is given its final bend 6 ,Relevant
After a final inspection the spark plugs are placed in open cartons that have been automatically formed,Relevant
The plugs are generally wrapped in plastic film placed first in a carton and then prepared for shipping in quantity to users,Relevant
The manufacture of stainless steel involves a series of processes,Irrelevant
First the steel is melted and then it is cast into solid form,Relevant
After various forming steps the steel is heat treated and then cleaned and polished to give it the desired finish,Relevant
Next it is packaged and sent to manufacturers who weld and join the steel to produce the desired shapes,Relevant
To make stainless steel the raw materialsiron ore chromium silicon nickel etc are melted together in an electric furnace,Relevant
This step usually involves 8 to 12 hours of intense heat,Irrelevant
Next the mixture is cast into one of several shapes including blooms billets and slabs,Relevant
The raw materials are first melted together in an electric furnace,Relevant
This step usually requires 8 to 12 hours of intense heat,Relevant
When the melting is finished the molten steel is cast into semi finished forms,Relevant
These include blooms rectangular shapes billets round or square shapes 1 5 inches or 3 8 centimeters in thickness slabs rods and tube rounds,Relevant
Next the semi finished steel goes through forming operations beginning with hot rolling in which the steel is heated and passed through huge rolls,Relevant
Blooms and billets are formed into bar and wire while slabs are formed into plate strip and sheet,Irrelevant
Bars are available in all grades and come in rounds squares octagons or hexagons 0 25 inch 63 centimeter in size,Irrelevant
Wire is usually available up to 0 5 inch 1 27 centimeters in diameter or size,Irrelevant
Plate is more than 0 1875 inch 47 centimeter thick and over 10 inches 25 4 centimeters wide,Irrelevant
Strip is less than 0 185 inch 47 centimeter thick and less than 24 inches 61 centimeters wide,Irrelevant
Sheet is less than 0 1875 47 centimeter thick and more than 24 61 centimeters wide,Irrelevant
After the stainless steel is formed most types must go through an annealing step,Irrelevant
Annealing is a heat treatment in which the steel is heated and cooled under controlled conditions to relieve internal stresses and soften the metal,Relevant
Some steels are heat treated for higher strength,Irrelevant
However such a heat treatmentalso known as age hardening requires careful control for even small changes from the recommended temperature time or cooling rate can seriously affect the properties,Irrelevant
Lower aging temperatures produce high strength with low fracture toughness while higher temperature aging produces a lower strength tougher material,Irrelevant
Though the heating rate to reach the aging temperature 900 to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit or 482 to 537 degrees Celsius does not effect the properties the cooling rate does,Irrelevant
A post aging quenching rapid cooling treatment can increase the toughness without a significant loss in strength,Irrelevant
One such process involves water quenching the material in a 35 degree Fahrenheit 1 6 degree Celsius ice water bath for a minimum of two hours,Irrelevant
The type of heat treatment depends on the type of steel in other words whether it is austenitic ferritic or martensitic,Irrelevant
Austenitic steels are heated to above 1900 degrees Fahrenheit 1037 degrees Celsius for a time depending on the thickness,Irrelevant
Water quenching is used for thick sections whereas air cooling or air blasting is used for thin sections,Irrelevant
If cooled too slowly carbide precipitation can occur,Irrelevant
This buildup can be eliminated by thermal stabilization,Irrelevant
In this method the steel is held for several hours at 1500 to 1600 degrees Fahrenheit 815 to 871 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Cleaning part surfaces of contaminants before heat treatment is sometimes also necessary to achieve proper heat treatment,Irrelevant
Annealing causes a scale or build up to form on the steel,Irrelevant
The scale can be removed using several processes,Irrelevant
One of the most common methods pickling uses a nitric hydrofluoric acid bath to descale the steel,Irrelevant
In another method electrocleaning an electric current is applied to the surface using a cathode and phosphoric acid and the scale is removed,Irrelevant
The annealing and descaling steps occur at different stages depending on the type of steel being worked,Irrelevant
Bar and wire for instance go through further forming steps more hot rolling forging or extruding after the initial hot rolling before being annealed and descaled,Irrelevant
Sheet and strip on the other hand go through an initial annealing and descaling step immediately after hot rolling,Relevant
After cold rolling passing through rolls at a relatively low temperature which produces a further reduction in thickness sheet and strip are annealed and descaled again,Relevant
A final cold rolling step then prepares the steel for final processing,Relevant
Cutting operations are usually necessary to obtain the desired blank shape or size to trim the part to final size,Relevant
Mechanical cutting is accomplished by a variety of methods including straight shearing using guillotine knives circle shearing using circular knives horizontally and vertically positioned sawing using high speed steel blades blanking and nibbling,Irrelevant
Blanking uses metal punches and dies to punch out the shape by shearing,Irrelevant
Nibbling is a process of cutting by blanking out a series of overlapping holes and is ideally suited for irregular shapes,Irrelevant
Stainless steel can also be cut using flame cutting which involves a flame fired torch using oxygen and propane in conjunction with iron powder,Irrelevant
This method is clean and fast,Irrelevant
Another cutting method is known as plasma jet cutting in which an ionized gas column in conjunction with an electric arc through a small orifice makes the cut,Irrelevant
The gas produces extremely high temperatures to melt the metal,Irrelevant
Surface finish is an important specification for stainless steel products and is critical in applications where appearance is also important,Irrelevant
Certain surface finishes also make stainless steel easier to clean which is obviously important for sanitary applications,Irrelevant
A smooth surface as obtained by polishing also provides better corrosion resistance,Relevant
On the other hand rough finishes are often required for lubrication applications as well as to facilitate further manufacturing steps,Irrelevant
Surface finishes are the result of processes used in fabricating the various forms or are the result of further processing,Irrelevant
There are a variety of methods used for finishing,Irrelevant
A dull finish is produced by hot rolling annealing and descaling,Relevant
A bright finish is obtained by first hot rolling and then cold rolling on polished rolls,Relevant
A highly reflective finish is produced by cold rolling in combination with annealing in a controlled atmosphere furnace by grinding with abrasives or by buffing a finely ground surface,Relevant
A mirror finish is produced by polishing with progressively finer abrasives followed by extensive buffing,Relevant
For grinding or polishing grinding wheels or abrasive belts are normally used,Irrelevant
Buffing uses cloth wheels in combination with cutting compounds containing very fine abrasive particles in bar or stick forms,Irrelevant
Other finishing methods include tumbling which forces movement of a tumbling material against surfaces of parts dry etching sandblasting wet etching using acid solutions and surface dulling,Irrelevant
The latter uses sandblasting wire brushing or pickling techniques,Relevant
The initial steel shapesblooms billets slabs etc are hot rolled into bar wire sheet strip and plate,Relevant
Depending on the form the steel then undergoes further rolling steps both hot and cold rolling heat treatment annealing descaling Ito remove buildup and polishing to produce the finished stainless steel,Irrelevant
The steel is then sent the end user,Relevant
After the stainless steel in its various forms are packed and shipped to the fabricator or end user a variety of other processes are needed,Relevant
Further shaping is accomplished using a variety of methods such as roll forming press forming forging press drawing and extrusion,Relevant
Additional heat treating annealing machining and cleaning processes are also often required,Relevant
While staplers are produced for a number of different uses and in just as many sizes the basic principles behind the workings of each remain the same and the chief components springs stampings rivets moldings and pins once completed are assembled to create similar finished products,Irrelevant
Two types of springs are used in the basic stapler the coil and the leaf,Irrelevant
A coil spring is made from metal that has the ability to withstand a constant pressure and release and still maintain its shape,Irrelevant
The coil spring material is wound around an appropriately sized rod similar to winding a thin wire around a pencil and is then heat treated to a produce changes in the metal s characteristicschanges that give the metal elasticity,Irrelevant
The heat treated coil spring can be pulled apart and pressed together within reason and still return to its original wound up condition ,Irrelevant
A good example of a coil spring is the follow spring which connects the case to the follow block the metal piece in the magazine that holds the staples toward one end of the magazine ,Irrelevant
The parts of a stapler are formed in various ways before coming together to form the finished item ,Irrelevant
Coil springs such as the follow spring are wound around rods and heat treated while leaf springs such as the clearing spring are rolled or bent to their proper shape ,Irrelevant
Sheet metal parts such as the head and base are typically stamped between a punch and die while plastic parts can be injection molded ,Relevant
Leaf springs which resemble a diving board are typically made by either bending or rolling slightly curling a thin piece of steel and then carefully heating it to a temperature that will cause internal stresses ,Irrelevant
Thinly slicing a carrot lengthwise into strips and then placing them in ice water causes the strips to curl up this is the same effect observed when springs are properly heat treated ,Relevant
The steel maintains either a curled or flat position and resists any bending motion applied to it ,Irrelevant
One example of a leaf spring is the clearing spring the part on the underside of the stapler that allow you to unlatch the base from the upper assembly the magazine and metal head ,Irrelevant
Stampings are typically made of flat sheet metal material of varying thicknesses that are sandwiched between a punch and die ,Irrelevant
When the punch pushes on the material it shears a piece of material the shape of the punch out of the sheet,Irrelevant
A similar principle is applied when using a cookie cutter on rolled out dough,Irrelevant
Stamping material can also be in the form of a coil of material that looks something like a roll of paper towel,Relevant
The material type and thickness depends on the configuration of the part being made ,Irrelevant
The coil allows automatic feeding of the material across a punch and die using a coil feeder,Irrelevant
The coil is gradually unwound as parts are stamped out of it,Irrelevant
This is a very cost efficient way of mass producing stampings because it does not require an operator to hold the material between the punch and die,Irrelevant
Most of the major metal components besides springs and rivets such as the base metal head and anvil are made in this way,Irrelevant
The pins stampings and springs are subassembled in stages and then assembled together with the upper and lower halves of the stapler frame,Irrelevant
The last items to be assembled are the feet lanti skid rubber pads and the snap on plastic cap,Irrelevant
After a part is stamped it is usually then formed into a shape,Relevant
If the shape is an intricate one another type of punch and die is used,Irrelevant
The material may also be heated in order to soften it allowing the material to bend more easily,Relevant
Most stapler parts have somewhat square corners so typically the material is bent at 90 degree angles,Irrelevant
There are now machines that perform stamping and brake forming processes during the same operation they simultaneously punch out shapes and bend them to make the appropriate parts,Relevant
This eliminates the amount of setups and different machines required to make all of the parts,Irrelevant
A rivet is usually made of a fairly strong steel material but it must also have some elasticity,Relevant
A rivet is designed to hold parts in place just like a screw and nut except that the rivet is one piece and cannot be easily disassembled,Relevant
One end typically has a head on it like a nail or a screw and the other end is usually hollow either partially or along the whole length ,Irrelevant
Rivets are made by cutting off a piece of bar stock and forging it to obtain the desired configuration,Irrelevant
Forging is a process similar to stamping except that the starting material is almost to size already,Irrelevant
Forging will minimally change the size and shape the strength of the material however is significantly increased,Irrelevant
Plastic parts of staplers are made by injection molding in which a liquified plastic is injected into a die,Relevant
The liquid flows into the open void and is then cooled,Relevant
As the die cools the plastic solidifies and takes on the shape of the die,Relevant
The die is opened and the part is removed,Relevant
The pin is little more than a piece of bar stock cut off to a certain length either with a saw or on a machining center,Relevant
Because the pin is used as a hinge point for the top and bottom half of the stapler it is usually made from a strong heat treatable metal,Irrelevant
As required to prevent rust or for cosmetic reasons some of the components are painted,Irrelevant
The parts are hung on small racks set on a conveyor and passed by a spray nozzle,Relevant
Some automatic painting operations employ electrostatic spraying wherein the parts and paint are electrically charged,Irrelevant
The paint and the parts are given opposite chargesfor instance the paint will be given a negative charge while the part will be given a positive chargebecause opposite electrical charges attract each other,Irrelevant
Electrostatic painting ensures that every possible space on the part will be evenly painted,Irrelevant
This method also eliminates wasted paint overspray ,Irrelevant
For the bottom subassembly consisting of the base hanger anvil and clearing spring the parts are placed in an assembly jig that holds them in position to allow the rivets to be placed in the correct holes,Relevant
Once the rivets are locked in place a tool called an orbital riveter spins the hollow end of the rivet until it collapses outward and captures the parts together,Relevant
The top half consisting of the magazine subassembly the case the follow spring the driver ram spring and the metal head is assembled the same way in it s own assembly jig,Relevant
The top and bottom halves come together in another jig and the pin that connects the two is riveted into place,Relevant
Finally the finishing touches such as the feet anti skid rubber pads and the plastic cap are then snapped on,Relevant
Although the stethoscope is a simple device it is typical for its metal parts and plastic parts to be manufactured at separate locations and for the entire device to be assembled at yet another location,Irrelevant
It is also common for inexpensive models to be sold disassembled,Irrelevant
Stethoscopes are rarely custom made,Irrelevant
If there is a large volume sold to one customer the manufacturer can make a certain specified color or put the name of the hospital onto the stethoscopes,Irrelevant
Aluminum is typically die cast,Irrelevant
In this process pressured molten aluminum is injected into molds forming a slug in the form of a crude binaural piece or chestpiece,Relevant
The slug is then machined to form its proper shape,Relevant
Stainless steel arrives in huge rods that are machined on lathes using a semiautomatic process,Relevant
Brass is also machined before being sent out for electroplating,Relevant
The machining process consists of cutting excess metal from the slug or rod according to a plan that will yield a correctly shaped binaural piece or chestpiece,Relevant
The binaural piece is then threaded at the top for the earplugs and barbs are cut into the bottom to allow for the tubing connection,Relevant
The chestpiece is also barbed at the top to allow for the connection,Relevant
The metal springs are then connected and sealed to the binaural pieces,Relevant
More expensive stethoscopes have tubing that is dipped,Irrelevant
The binaural pieces are repeatedly dipped into a liquid latex until the tubes are of the correct thickness,Relevant
Tubes intended for inexpensive or disassembled models are molded or extruded using standard methods,Relevant
To attach the separate tubing it is first heated by placing it in warm water next it is pushed onto the binaural pieces wrapping snugly around the barbs,Relevant
Another less common method of attaching the tubing is to place the binaural pieces in a mold and then place the tubing around them to form a seal,Relevant
Stethoscopes are hand assembled,Irrelevant
Once the binaural pieces have tubes the diaphragm is placed in the chestpiece and sealed,Relevant
Next the anti chill ring is put on both sides of the chestpiece,Relevant
This can be done by cutting a recess in a circular track around the rim and slipping the ring inside,Relevant
The preferred method is to stretch the ring around the rim of the diaphragm or bell making a secure fit,Irrelevant
The earplugs are then screwed on,Relevant
Inexpensive stethoscopes which may be disassembled are placed in bags and sealed,Relevant
Mid range stethoscopes are boxed,Relevant
Quality stethoscopes are placed in sturdy boxes that have spaces die cut in the packaging into which the stethoscope and accessories fit snugly,Relevant
The stethoscopes are then placed in cases that hold 20 to 50 boxes each and shipped to medical supply dealers or if there is a large volume directly to a hospital,Relevant
The medical supply dealers then provide stethoscopes to private practice hospitals medical supply stores and drug stores,Relevant
Sugarcane requires an average temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit 23 9 degrees Celsius and uniform rainfall of about 80 inches 203 centimeters per year,Irrelevant
Therefore it is grown in tropical or subtropical areas,Irrelevant
In the United States harvesting of both cane and sugar beet is done primarily by machine although in some states it is also done by hand,Irrelevant
The harvested cane stalks and beets are loaded mechanically into trucks or railroad cars and taken to mills for processing into raw sugar,Relevant
Once there they are cleaned washed milled to extract juice filtered and purified,Relevant
The result is a clear sugar filled juice,Relevant
Sugarcane takes about seven months to mature in a tropical area and about 12 22 months in a subtropical area,Irrelevant
At this time fields of sugarcane are tested for sucrose and the most mature fields are harvested first,Relevant
In Florida Hawaii and Texas standing cane is fired to burn off the dry leaves,Irrelevant
In Louisiana the six to ten feet 1 8 to 3 meter tall cane stalks are cut down and laid on the ground before burning,Irrelevant
In the United States harvesting of both cane and sugar beet is done primarily by machine although in some states it is also done by hand,Irrelevant
The harvested cane stalks are loaded mechanically into trucks or railroad cars and taken to mills for processing into raw sugar,Relevant
After the cane arrives at the mill yards it is mechanically unloaded and excessive soil and rocks are removed,Relevant
The cane is cleaned by flooding the carrier with warm water in the case of sparse rock and trash clutter or by spreading the cane on agitating conveyors that pass through strong jets of water and combing drums to remove larger amounts of rocks trash and leaves etc ,Relevant
At this point the cane is clean and ready to be milled,Relevant
When the beets are delivered at the refinery they are first washed and then cut into strips,Relevant
Next they are put into diffusion cells with water at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit 79 4 degrees Celsius and sprayed with hot water countercurrently to remove the sucrose,Relevant
After being purifed the clear juice undergoes vacuum evaporation to remove most of the water,Relevant
In this process four vacuum boiling cells are arranged in series so that each succeeding cell has a higher vacuum,Relevant
The vapors from one body can thus boil the juice in the next one a method called multiple effect evaporation,Irrelevant
Next the syrupy solution is vacuum crystallized to form sugar crystals,Relevant
The remaining liquid is removed using centrifugaling and drying and the sugar is packaged,Relevant
Two or three heavily grooved crusher rollers break the cane and extract a large part of the juice or swing hammer type shredders 1 200 RPM shred the cane without extracting the juice,Relevant
Revolving knives cutting the stalks into chips are supplementary to the crushers,Relevant
In most countries the shredder precedes the crusher ,Irrelevant
A combination of two or even all three methods may be used,Irrelevant
The pressing process involves crushing the stalks between the heavy and grooved metal rollers to separate the fiber bagasse from the juice that contains the sugar,Relevant
As the cane is crushed hot water or a combination of hot water and recovered impure juice is sprayed onto the crushed cane countercurrently as it leaves each mill for diluting,Relevant
The extracted juice called vesou contains 95 percent or more of the sucrose present,Irrelevant
The mass is then diffused a process that involves finely cutting or shredding the stalks,Relevant
Next the sugar is separated from the cut stalks by dissolving it in hot water or hot juice,Relevant
The juice from the mills a dark green color is acid and turbid,Irrelevant
The clarification or defecation process is designed to remove both soluble and insoluble impurities such as sand soil and ground rock that have not been removed by preliminary screening,Relevant
The process employs lime and heat as the clarifying agents,Irrelevant
Milk of lime about one pound per ton of cane neutralizes the natural acidity of the juice forming insoluble lime salts,Relevant
Heating the lime juice to boiling coagulates the albumin and some of the fats waxes and gums and the precipitate formed entraps suspended solids as well as the minute particles,Relevant
The sugar beet solution on the other hand is purified by precipitating calcium carbonate calcium sulfite or both in it repeatedly,Relevant
Impurities become entangled in the growing crystals of precipitate and are removed by continuous filtration,Relevant
The muds separate from the clear juice through sedimentation,Relevant
The non sugar impurities are removed by continuous filtration,Relevant
The final clarified juice contains about 85 percent water and has the same composition as the raw extracted juice except for the removed impurities,Irrelevant
To concentrate this clarified juice about two thirds of the water is removed through vacuum evaporation,Relevant
Generally four vacuum boiling cells or bodies are arranged in series so that each succeeding body has a higher vacuum and therefore boils at a lower temperature ,Irrelevant
The vapors from one body can thus boil the juice in the next onethe steam introduced into the first cell does what is called multiple effect evaporation,Relevant
The vapor from the last cell goes to a condenser,Relevant
The syrup leaves the last body continuously with about 65 percent solids and 35 percent water,Irrelevant
The sugar beet sucrose solution at this point is also nearly colorless and it likewise undergoes multiple effect vacuum evaporation,Irrelevant
The syrup is seeded cooled and put in a centrifuge machine,Relevant
The finished beet crystals are washed with water and dried,Relevant
Crystallization is the next step in the manufacture of sugar,Relevant
Crystallization takes place in a single stage vacuum pan,Irrelevant
The syrup is evaporated until saturated with sugar,Relevant
As soon as the saturation point has been exceeded small grains of sugar are added to the pan or strike,Relevant
These small grains called seed serve as nuclei for the formation of sugar crystals Seed grain is formed by adding 56 ounces [1 600 grams] of white sugar into the bowl of a slurry machine and mixing with 3 3 parts of a liquid mixture 70 percent methylated spirit and 30 percent glycerine The machine runs at 200 RPM for 15 hours Additional syrup is added to the strike and evaporated so that the original crystals that were formed are allowed to grow in size The growth of the crystals continues until the pan is full When sucrose concentration reaches the desired level the dense mixture of syrup and sugar crystals called massecuite is discharged into large containers known as crystallizers Crystallization continues in the crystallizers as the massecuite is slowly stirred and cooled 10 Massecuite from the mixers is allowed to flow into centrifugals where the thick syrup or molasses is separated from the raw sugar by centrifugal force 11 The high speed centrifugal action used to separate the massecuite into raw sugar crystals and molasses is done in revolving machines called centrifugals A centrifugal machine has a cylindrical basket suspended on a spindle with perforated sides lined with wire cloth inside which are metal sheets containing 400 to 600 perforations per square inch The basket revolves at speeds from 1 000 to 1 800 RPM The raw sugar is retained in the centrifuge basket because the perforated lining retains the sugar crystals The mother liquor or molasses passes through the lining due to the centrifugal force exerted The final molasses blackstrap molasses containing sucrose reducing sugars organic nonsugars ash and water is sent to large storage tanks Once the sugar is centrifuged it is cut down and sent to a granulator for drying,Relevant
In some countries sugarcane is processed in small factories without the use of centrifuges and a dark brown product noncentrifugal sugar is produced,Irrelevant
Centrifugal sugar is produced in more than 60 countries while noncentrifugal sugar in about twenty countries,Irrelevant
Damp sugar crystals are dried by being tumbled through heated air in a granulator,Relevant
The dry sugar crystals are then sorted by size through vibrating screens and placed into storage bins,Relevant
Sugar is then sent to be packed in the familiar packaging we see in grocery stores in bulk packaging or in liquid form for industrial use,Relevant
C A s are produced in heated kettles that can hold from a few gallons to several thousand gallons the size depends upon the scale of the particular manufacturing operation,Irrelevant
1 The initial ingredient is ethyl cyanoacetate,Irrelevant
Placed into a glass lined kettle with revolving mixing blades this material is then mixed with formaldehyde,Relevant
The mixing of the two chemicals triggers condensation a chemical reaction that produces water that is then evaporated as the kettle is heated,Relevant
When the water has evaporated what remains in the kettle is the C A polymer,Irrelevant
The separated monomers are piped to a second kette,Relevant
The contents of the second collecting container the one holding the liquid monomers are effectively the C A glue although they still need to be proteed against curing,Relevant
After receiving any necessary additives the glue is packaged accordingly,Relevant
2 Because the C A will begin to cure or harden on contact with any moisture the kettle space left empty by the evaporation of the water is filled with a nonreactive gas such as nitrogen,Relevant
3 Next the kettle is heated to a temperature of approximately 305 degrees Fahrenheit 150 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Heating the mixture causes thermal cracking of the polymer creating reactive monomers chemically ethyl cyanoacrylate esters with a slightly different process methyl cyanoacrylate esters are possible that will when the finished glue is applied recombine to form a bond,Relevant
4 Because the monomers are lighter than the polymer they volatize upward and are piped out of the kettle into a second collector,Relevant
The process is not unlike distilling although the goal is a glue rather than an alcoholic beverage,Irrelevant
In going from one vessel to the other the monomers move through a series of cooling coils that allow them to become liquid,Relevant
A second distilling might be performed for a high quality product and some manufacturers might even distill the monomers a third time,Irrelevant
5 The contents of the second collecting container the one holding the liquid monomers are effectively the C A glue although they still need to be protected against curing,Relevant
Various chemicals called free radical inhibitors and base scavengers are added to precipitate out impurities that would otherwise harden the mixture,Relevant
Because the quantities of impurities and precipitates are small measurable in nothing larger than parts per million there is no need to remove them from the C A Mixture,Relevant
If particles of precipitate were visible even under several hundred magnifications it would be a sign of severe contamination and the batch would be destroyed,Relevant
6 The C A glue can at this point receive any additives that the manufacturer wishes,Relevant
These additives can control the viscosity of the C A in fact at least three different thicknesses are sold or they can allow the glue to work on material types that earlier C A s could not,Relevant
A thicker viscosity is desired when bonding is to be done on surfaces that don t meet very well the thicker viscosity allows the glue to fill the empty spaces before it sets,Relevant
Without other additives C A s might need to be restricted to nonporous surfaces,Relevant
With additives in the C A or with some surface preparation the C A will work very well,Relevant
C A technology is sufficiently mature that a manufacturer can meet a request from a customer for a C A that will bond almost any given pair of surfaces,Irrelevant
7 The C A can now be added to tubes using conventional albeit humidity free techniques,Relevant
Once a tube is filled a top is fitted and crimped on and the bottom of the tube is crimped closed,Relevant
Because most metal tubes would react with the C A packaging tubes are usually made of a plastic material such as polyethylene although aluminum tubes are possible,Irrelevant
Once the C A is exposed to moisture or an alkaline either in the air or on the surfaces being glued the monomers will repolymerize and harden forming a tremendously strong bond between the two substances,Relevant
The reaction is total the entire amount of C A that has been placed on the substances will polymerize,Relevant
Although there are numerous types of thermometers the production process for the most common of thesethe classic household varietyis described below,Irrelevant
First the raw glass material is received from an outside manufacturer,Relevant
The tube is made with a fine passage or bore throughout its length,Relevant
The bored tubes are checked for quality any rejected parts are sent back to the manufacturer for replacement,Relevant
The bulb reservoir is formed by heating one end of the glass tube pinching it closed and using glassblowing and the application of an air driven torch to complete it,Relevant
Alternately the bulb can be made by blowing a separate piece of lab material that is then joined with one end of the glass tube,Relevant
The bulb is sealed at its bottom leaving an open tube at the top,Relevant
With the open end down in a vacuum chamber air is then evacuated from the glass tube and the hydrocarbon fluid is introduced into the vacuum until it penetrates the tube about 1 inch 2 54 centimeters ,Relevant
Due to environmental concerns contemporary thermometers are manufactured less with mercury and more with a spirit filled hydrocarbon liquid,Irrelevant
Such a practice is mandated with tolerance for a limited use of mercury by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA ,Irrelevant
The vacuum is then gradually reduced forcing the fluid down near the top of the tube,Relevant
The process is the same when mercury is used except heat is also applied in the vacuum chamber,Relevant
Once full the tube is placed upon its bulb end,Relevant
A heating out process is then conducted by placing the thermometer into a warm bath and raising the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit 204 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
Next the temperature is reduced to room temperature to bring the residual liquid back to a known level,Relevant
The open end of the thermometer is then sealed by placing it over a flame,Relevant
After the tube is sealed a scale is applied based on the level at which the fluid rests when inserted into a water bath of 212 degrees Fahrenheit 100 degrees Celsius versus one at 32 degrees Fahrenheit 0 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
These reference points for the desired scale are marked on the glass tube before engraving or silkscreening is done to fill gradations,Relevant
The range lengths vary according to the design used,Relevant
A scale is picked that best corresponds to even marks between the reference points,Relevant
For accuracy purposes engraving is the preferred method of marking,Irrelevant
The marks are made by an engraving engine after the thermometer is placed in wax,Relevant
The numbers are scratched onto the glass and once complete the thermometer is dipped in hydrofluoric acid to seal the engraved markings,Relevant
Ink is then rubbed into the marks to highlight the scale values,Relevant
When enclosures are used on the scales a silkscreening process is used to apply the marks,Relevant
Finally the thermometers are packaged accordingly and shipped to customers,Relevant
A passenger car tire is manufactured by wrapping multiple layers of specially formulated rubber around a metal drum in a tire forming machine,Irrelevant
The different components of the tire are carried to the forming machine where a skilled assembler cuts and positions the strips to form the different parts of the tire called a green tire at this point,Relevant
When a green tire is finished the metal drum collapses allowing the tire assembler to remove the tire,Relevant
The green tire is then taken to a mold for curing,Relevant
The first step in the tire manufacturing process is the mixing of raw materialsrubber carbon black sulfur and other materialsto form the rubber compound,Relevant
After the rubber is prepared it is sent to a tire building machine where a worker builds up the rubber layers to form the tire,Relevant
At this point the tire is called a green tire,Irrelevant
The first step in the tire manufacturing process is the mixing of raw materials to form the rubber compound,Irrelevant
Railcars deliver large quantities of natural and synthetic rubber carbon black sulfur and other chemicals and oils all of which are stored until needed,Relevant
Computer control systems contain various recipes and can automatically measure out specific batches of rubber and chemicals for mixing,Irrelevant
Gigantic mixers hanging like vertical cement mixers stir the rubber and chemicals together in batches weighing up to 1 100 pounds,Irrelevant
Each mix is then remilled with additional heating to soften the batch and mix the chemicals,Relevant
In a third step the batch goes through a mixer again where additional chemicals are added to form what is known as the final mix,Relevant
During all three steps of mixing heat and friction are applied to the batch to soften the rubber and evenly distribute the chemicals,Relevant
The chemical composition of each batch depends on the tire partcertain rubber formulations are used for the body other formulas for the beads and others for the tread,Irrelevant
Once a batch of rubber has been mixed it goes through powerful rolling mills that squeeze the batch into thick sheets,Relevant
These sheets are then used to make the specific parts of the tire,Relevant
The tire body for instance consists of strips of cloth like fabric that are covered with rubber,Irrelevant
Each strip of rubberized fabric is used to form a layer called a ply in the tire body,Irrelevant
A passenger car tire may have as many as four plies in the body,Irrelevant
For the beads of a tire wire bundles are formed on a wire wrapping machine,Relevant
The bundles are then formed into rings and the rings are covered with rubber,Relevant
The rubber for the tire tread and sidewalls travels from the batch mixer to another type of processing machine called an extruder,Relevant
In the extruder the batch is further mixed and heated and is then forced out through a diea shaped orificeto form a layer of rubber,Relevant
Sidewall rubber is covered with a protective plastic sheet and rolled,Relevant
Tread rubber is sliced into strips and loaded into large flat metal cases called books,Relevant
The rolls of sidewall rubber the books containing tread rubber and the racks of After the green tire is made it is put in a mold for curing,Relevant
Shaped like a clam the mold contains a large flexible balloon,Irrelevant
The tire is placed over the balloon bladder and the mold closes,Relevant
Next steam is pumped into the balloon expanding it to shape the tire against the sides of the mold,Relevant
After cooling the tire is inflated and tested,Relevant
After the green tire is made it is put in a mold for curing,Relevant
After cooling the tire is inflated and tested beads are all delivered to a skilled assembler at a tire building machine,Relevant
At the center of the machine is a collapsible rotating drum that holds the tire parts,Irrelevant
The tire assembler starts building a tire by wrapping the rubber covered fabric plies of the body around the machine drum,Relevant
After the ends of these plies are joined with glue the beads are added and locked into place with additional tire body plies laid over the beads,Relevant
Next the assembler uses special power tools to shape the edges of the tire plies,Relevant
Finally the extruded rubber layers for the sidewalls and tread are glued into place and the assembled tirethe green tireis removed from the tire building machine,Relevant
A green tire is placed inside a large mold for the curing process,Relevant
A tire mold is shaped like a monstrous metal clam which opens to reveal a large flexible balloon called a bladder,Irrelevant
The green tire is placed over the bladder and as the clamshell mold closes the bladder fills with steam and expands to shape the tire and force the blank tread rubber against the raised interior of the mold,Relevant
During this curing process the steam heats the green tire up to 280 degrees,Irrelevant
Time in the mold depends on the characteristics desired in the tire,Irrelevant
After curing is complete the tire is removed from the mold for cooling and then testing,Relevant
Each tire is thoroughly inspected for flaws such as bubbles or voids in the rubber of the tread sidewall and interior of the tire,Relevant
Then the tire is placed on a test wheel inflated and spun,Relevant
Sensors in the test wheel measure the balance of the tire and determine if the tire runs in a straight line,Relevant
Because of the design and assembly of a modern tire rarely is one rejected,Relevant
Once the tire has been inspected and run on the test wheel it is moved to a warehouse for distribution,Relevant
The first major process in tortilla chip manufacturing is the production of coarse masa or dough,Irrelevant
In a typical mixture 2 5 to 3 0 liters of water 1 kilogram of 12 percent moist com and 0 01 kilogram of food grade lime usually quicklime or hydrated lime are added together in a large industrial cooker,Relevant
The lime is used primarily as an aid in removing the pericarp hull or skin during cooking and steeping,Relevant
The lime also helps to increase the product shelf life by controlling microbial activity and it affects the flavor aroma color and nutritional value of the chips,Relevant
To make tortilla chips manufacturers first mix the raw ingredientswater moist corn and limeto form the masa or dough,Relevant
Next the mixture is heated in a large kettle such as a Hamilton kettle which is heated indirectly by steam,Relevant
After steeping which allows water to be absorbed the solution is washed and pumped onto a conveyor belt for transport to the grinder,Relevant
This mixture is then batch cooked in either a Hamilton steam kettle or a vertical closed cooker,Relevant
The Hamilton kettle is indirectly heated by steam and the grain contents are mechanically agitated,Relevant
It is designed for cooking at or near the boiling point of the lime water corn solution,Irrelevant
An elaborate agitation system ensures the uniform transfer of heat by condensing steam through the kettle wall and into the limewater corn solution,Relevant
The capacity of these steam jacketed kettles ranges from 300 to 595 pounds 136 to 270 kilograms ,Irrelevant
The vertical closed cooker uses direct steam injection to heat and agitate the lime water corn solution in a large tank which serves for both cooking and steeping,Relevant
Additional agitation is accomplished with compressed air,Relevant
Because this system is designed for cooking at temperatures well below the solution boiling point 185 degrees Fahrenheit or 85 degrees Celsius the cooking time is longer than in the Hamilton steam kettles,Irrelevant
The capacity of the vertical cookers ranges from 3 000 to 6 000 pounds 1 360 to 2 730 kilograms ,Irrelevant
Cooking time can vary greatly from a few minutes to a half hour depending upon which system is used,Irrelevant
In general temperatures above 155 degrees Fahrenheit 68 degrees Celsius are considered to be the optimum cooking temperatures,Irrelevant
Cooking depends on the characteristics of the corn and the interaction of time temperature lime concentration cooking vessel size and agitation,Irrelevant
Nixtamal used for fried products is generally cooked less than nixtamal used for table tortillas,Irrelevant
Immediately after cooking the solution is quenched rapidly cooled to about 154 to 162 degrees Fahrenheit 68 72 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
This lower temperature decreases water absorption during the steeping process and the cooking time of the nixtamal,Irrelevant
The result is a more consistent masa which absorbs less oil during frying,Irrelevant
The grain is then steeped for 8 to 16 hours in the cooking vat if a vertical cooker was used or transferred to a holding vat if a Hamilton steam kettle was used ,Relevant
The steeping process allows water to be absorbed which helps to disintegrate the hull and soften the kernel,Irrelevant
During the steeping process the temperature is dropped to 104 degrees Fahrenheit 40 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
After steeping the solution is pumped into the washers,Relevant
The cooking liquor is drained off and the resulting nixtamal is washed with pressurized water or spraying systems,Relevant
Most of the pericarp and excess lime is removed during this step,Relevant
Washing in commercial processes is done in two types of equipment the drum washer and the lowboy system,Irrelevant
A drum washer consists of a conveyor that transports the nixtamal into a rotating perforated cylinder with internal flights and water sprayers located within the drum,Irrelevant
After spraying the nixtamal passes into a drain conveyor where the excess water is removed,Relevant
The lowboy system consists of a receptacle equipped with internal screens and sprayers,Irrelevant
The washed nixtamal is continuously removed from the bottom of the receptacle by an inclined belt conveyor,Relevant
In both systems a conveyor transports the washed drained nixtamal into a hopper which then feeds the stone grinder,Relevant
The end result using the typical corn and lime mixture will be 54 ounces 1 53 kilograms of 47 percent moist nixtamal,Irrelevant
The washed nixtamal is then ground using two matched carved stones one stationary and the other rotating at about 500 to 700 rpm,Relevant
The stones are usually composed of lava or volcanic materials although they can also consist of synthetic materials made of aluminum oxide Ak203 ,Irrelevant
For optimum efficiency the lava stones must be frequently recarved the synthetic stones last longer and require less recarving,Irrelevant
A typical stone is 10 centimeters thick and 40 centimeters in diameter and has radial grooves,Irrelevant
The grooves become more shallow as they approach the perimeter of the stone,Irrelevant
The number design and depth of the grooves in the stones vary with the intended product stones carved for the production of table tortillas have more shallow grooves to produce a finer masa whereas coarser masa for tortilla chips comes from deeper grooved stones,Irrelevant
The grinding or milling starts when a screw conveyor at the base of the hopper forces the nixtamal through a center opening and into the gap between the stones where shearing occurs,Relevant
The material travels outward from the center to the perimeter of the stones,Relevant
Water added during milling cools the stones prevents excessive wear and reduces the masa temperature,Relevant
For a grinder with a capacity of 600 kg hr about 0 6 to 1 2 liters of water per minute 0 16 0 32 gpm is added ,Irrelevant
This amount of water increases the masa moisture content to the optimum for sheeting,Relevant
Like the grinding stones the moisture content depends upon the resulting product,Irrelevant
The masa particle size is the result of several interacting factors degree of nixtamal cooking size and depth of the grooves in the grinding stones gap or pressure between the grinding stones amount of water used during milling and the type of corn used,Irrelevant
The grinding breaks up the kernel structure and promotes plastic and cohesive properties in the masa,Relevant
Once the masa is produced it is important to use it immediately or to protect it against moisture loss,Relevant
After grinding the resulting mixture will be 1 65 kilograms of 51 percent moist coarse masa,Irrelevant
Next actual chips are produced using the coarse masa which is kneaded and mixed into plastic masa by mixers and extruders and then fed to sheeter rolls,Relevant
The plastic masa is sheeted into a thin layer which is then cut or forced into a specific configuration the thickness of the sheet determines the final product weight,Relevant
The sheeting starts when the masa is fed onto a pair of smooth rollers usually The washed solution is ground using two matched carved stones one stationary and the other rotating,Irrelevant
After frying and seasoning the chips are packaged accordingly,Relevant
The washed solution is ground using two matched carved stones one stationary and the other rotating,Irrelevant
From there the resulting coarse masa is cut into actual chips,Relevant
The masa is fed onto a pair of smooth rollers usually coated with Teflon one rotating counterclockwise and the other clockwise,Relevant
The masa is forced between the rolls cut and discharged into the oven for baking,Relevant
After frying and seasoning the chips are packaged accordingly coated with Teflon one rotating counter clockwise and the other clockwise,Relevant
The gap between the rollers is adjustable so that products of different thicknesses can be produced,Irrelevant
The masa is forced between the rolls and separated by wires located on the front and back rolls,Relevant
The back wire cleans the sheeted masa from the back roll and allows it to adhere to the front roll and the front wire or wires strip the masa pieces from the roll,Relevant
The cutter rotates underneath the front roll,Relevant
Different cutter configurations triangular circular rectangular etc are used for various products,Irrelevant
Copper or plastic bands surround the end of the first roll and help to recycle excess masa,Relevant
The masa pieces leave the front roller on a discharge belt which feeds directly into the oven,Relevant
A three tiered gas fired oven is used to bake the formed masa,Relevant
Generally the chips are baked at temperatures ranging from 500 to 554 degrees Fahrenheit 260 290 degrees Celsius with the baking time varying from 35 to 50 seconds,Relevant
Baking enhances the alkaline flavor and reduces moisture and oil absorption during frying,Irrelevant
The tortilla chips are then cooled by moving through a series of open tiers or cooling racks,Relevant
The chips are sometimes cooled for up to 20 minutes before frying to produce a more uniform consistency and to reduce blistering during frying,Irrelevant
During this cooling process the chips lose additional moisture up to 3 percent and the moisture within each chip becomes more evenly distributed,Relevant
The next step involves frying the chips using oil temperatures ranging from 338 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit 170 190 degrees Celsius for 50 to 80 seconds,Relevant
The frying temperature and time depend on the type of product,Irrelevant
Tortilla chips made from yellow corn require a lower frying temperature and a longer time than chips made from white or blended white and yellow corn,Irrelevant
For example corn chips made from yellow corn are fried at 320 degrees Fahrenheit 160 degrees Celsius while those made from blended white and yellow corn are fried at temperatures up to 410 degrees Fahrenheit 210 degrees Celsius for 60 to 90 seconds,Irrelevant
Most of the commercial fryers used are the continuous type with direct or indirect heating elements,Irrelevant
Indirect fired fryers are more expensive but more efficient with lower operational costs,Irrelevant
Modern fryers are designed to filter out fines very small pieces continuously and be easy to clean,Irrelevant
These commercial fryers are available in sizes that can process from 160 to 1 360 kg hr 353 3 000 lbs hr ,Irrelevant
The process yield using the typical corn lime mixture will be 0 96 kilograms 2 1 pounds of tortilla chips with 22 to 24 percent oil and less than 2 percent moisture,Irrelevant
The salt and seasonings are applied immediately after frying while the chips are still hot,Relevant
The hot chips are conveyed into an inclined rotating cylinder where a liquid seasoning mix is sprayed on them,Relevant
Generally the liquid mix consists of hot oil salt seasonings and flavoring and coloring agents,Irrelevant
Upon cooling the oil crystallizes forming the seasoning coat,Relevant
Salt can also be deposited on the chips as a liquid spray or by a granulated salt dispenser positioned over the conveying belts after the tumbling operation,Relevant
The amount of salt usually added to tortilla chips is about 1 to 1 5 percent by weight,Irrelevant
The tortilla chips are then cooled to ambient temperature and immediately packaged in moistureproof bags,Relevant
Because fried products are very hygroscopic they readily absorb and retain moisture delayed packaging can cause a loss of crispness,Irrelevant
The cooled tortilla chips with about 1 5 percent moisture are conveyed into a bagging machine,Relevant
This machine automatically weighs and deposits them in a bag which is then sealed,Relevant
The main tube of the trumpet is manufactured from standard machinable brass that is first put on a pole shaped tapered mandrel and lubricated,Relevant
A die that looks like a doughnut is then drawn down its entire length thus tapering and shaping it properly,Relevant
Next the shaped tube is annealedheated to around 1 000 degrees Fahrenheit or 538 degrees Celsius to make it workable,Relevant
This causes an oxide to form on the surface of the brass,Irrelevant
To remove the oxidized residue the tube must be bathed in diluted sulfuric acid before being bent,Relevant
The main tube may be bent using one of three different methods,Irrelevant
Some large manufacturers use hydraulic systems to push high pressure water at approximately 27 580 kilopascals through slightly bent tubing that has been placed in a die,Relevant
The water presses the sides of the tubing to fit the mold exactly,Relevant
Other large manufacturers send ball bearings of exact size through the tubing,Irrelevant
Smaller manufacturers pour pitch into the tube let it cool then use a lever to bend the tube in a standard curve before hammering it into shape,Irrelevant
The bell is cut from sheet brass using an exact pattern,Relevant
The flat dress shaped sheet is then hammered around a pole,Relevant
Where the tube is cylindrical the ends are brought together into a butt joint,Relevant
Where the tube begins to flare the ends are overlapped to form a lap joint,Relevant
The entire joint is then brazed with a propane oxygen flame at 1 500 to 1 600 degrees Fahrenheit 816 to 871 degrees Celsius to seal it,Relevant
To make a rough bell shape one end is hammered around the horn of a blacksmith anvil,Relevant
The entire tube is then drawn on a mandrel exactly like the main tube while the bell is spun on the mandrel,Relevant
A thin wire is placed around the bell s rim and metal is crimped around it to give the edge its crisp appearance,Relevant
The bell is then soldered to the main tube,Relevant
The knuckles and accessory tubing are first drawn on a mandrel as were the tube and bell,Relevant
The knuckles are bent into 30 45 60 and 90 degree angles and the smaller tubes are bent using either the hydraulic or ball bearing methods used to bend the main tubing annealed and washed in acid to remove oxides and flux from soldering,Relevant
The valve cases are cut to length from heavy tubing and threaded at the ends,Relevant
They then need to have holes cut into them that match those of the pistons,Relevant
Even small manufacturers now have available computer programs that precisely measure where the holes should be drawn,Irrelevant
The valve cases can be cut with drills whose heads are either pinpoint or rotary saws that cut the holes after which pins prick out the scrap disk of metal,Relevant
The knuckles tubes and valve cases are then placed in jigs that hold them precisely and their joints are painted with a solder and flux mixture using a blow torch,Relevant
After an acid bath the assembly is polished on a buffing machine using wax of varying grittiness and muslin discs of varying roughness that rotate at high speeds 2 500 rpm is typical ,Relevant
The entire trumpet can now be assembled,Relevant
The side tubes for the valve slides are joined to the knuckles and the main tubing is united end to end by overlapping their ferrules and soldering,Relevant
Next the pistons are then inserted and the entire valve assembly is screwed onto the main tubing,Relevant
The mouthpiece is then inserted,Relevant
The trumpet is cleaned polished and lacquered or it is sent to be electroplated,Relevant
The finishing touch is to engrave the name of the company on a prominent piece of tubing,Relevant
The lettering is transferred to the metal with carbon paper and a skilled engraver then carves the metal to match the etching,Relevant
Trumpets are shipped either separately for special orders or in mass quantities for high school bands,Relevant
They are wrapped carefully in thick plastic bubble packaging or other insulating material placed in heavy boxes full of insulation such as packaging peanuts then mailed or sent as freight to the customer,Relevant
Modern umbrellas are made by a hand assembly process that except for a few critical areas can be done by semi skilled workers,Irrelevant
Choices of materials and quality control occur throughout the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
Although a well made umbrella need not be expensive almost every purchasing decision impacts directly upon the quality of the final product,Irrelevant
Collapsible rain umbrellas that telescope into a length of about a foot are the most recent innovations in umbrellas,Irrelevant
Though mechanically more complicated than stick umbrellas they share the same basic technology,Irrelevant
Among the differences between a stick umbrella and a collapsible umbrella is that the collapsible uses a two piece shaft that telescopes into itself and an extra set of runners along the top of the umbrella,Irrelevant
This section will focus on the manufacture of a stick umbrella,Irrelevant
The stick umbrella will usually begin its life as a shaft of either wood steel or aluminum approximately 3 8 inch 95 centimeter thick,Irrelevant
Fiberglass and other plastics are occasionally used and in fact they are common in the larger golf umbrella,Irrelevant
Wood The fabric for the canopy is usually a nylon taffeta with an acrylic coating on the underside and a scotch guard type finish on the top,Irrelevant
Other fabrics besides nylon might be used according to need or taste a patio umbrella attached to an outdoor table does not have to be lightweight and waterproof as much as a customer might want it to be large durable and attractive,Irrelevant
from various types of ash trees including Rowan wood from Asia is among the popular choices for a sturdy wood shaft,Irrelevant
While wood shafts are made using standard wood shaping machines such as turning machines and lathes metal and plastic shafts can be drawn or extruded to the proper shape,Irrelevant
The ribs and stretchers are assembled first usually from U shaped or channeled steel or other metal,Relevant
Ribs run underneath the top or canopy of the umbrella stretchers connect the ribs with the shaft of the umbrella,Irrelevant
The ribs are attached to the shaft of the umbrella by fitting into a top notcha thin round nylon or plastic piece with teeth around the edges and then held with thin wire,Relevant
The stretchers are connected to the shaft of the umbrella with a plastic or metal runner the piece that moves along the shaft of the umbrella when it is opened or closed,Relevant
Next the ribs and stretchers are connected to each other with a joiner which is usually a small jointed metal hinge as the umbrella is opened or closed the joiner opens or closes through an angle of more than 90 degrees,Relevant
There are two catch springs in the shaft of each umbrella these are small pieces of metal that need to be pressed when the umbrella is slid up the shaft to open and again when the umbrella is slid down the shaft for closing,Irrelevant
Metal shafts are usually hollow and the catch spring can be inserted while a wood shaft requires that a space for the catch spring be hollowed out,Irrelevant
A pin or other blocking device is usually placed into the shaft a few inches above the upper catch spring to prevent the canopy from sliding past the top of umbrella when the runner goes beyond the upper catch spring,Relevant
The cover or canopy of the umbrella is hand sewn in individual panels to the ribs,Relevant
Because each panel has to be shaped to the curve of the canopy the cover cannot be cut in one piece,Irrelevant
Panels are sewn at the outer edges of the ribs and there are also connections between the ribs and the panels about one third of the way down from the outer edge of the canopy,Relevant
Each panel is cut separately from piles of materials called gores machine cutting of several layers at once is possible although hand cutting is more typical,Relevant
The typical rain umbrella has eight panels although some umbrellas with six panels children s umbrellas and parasols usually have six panels and as many as twelve can occasionally be found,Irrelevant
At one point the number of panels in an umbrella may have been an indication of quality or at least of the amount of attention the umbrella maker paid to his product ,Irrelevant
Today because of the quality of the material available to the umbrella maker the number of panels is usually a matter of style and taste rather than quality,Irrelevant
The fabric used in a good quality umbrella canopy is usually a nylon taffeta rated at 190T 190 threads per inch with an acrylic coating on the underside and a scotch guard type finish on the top,Relevant
The coating and finish are usually applied by the fabric supplier,Relevant
Fabric patterns and designs can be chosen by the manufacturer or the manufacturer might add his own patterns and designs using a rotary or silk screening process especially for a special order of a limited number of umbrellas,Irrelevant
Similarly other fabrics besides nylon might be used according to need or taste a patio umbrella attached to an outdoor table does not have to be lightweight and waterproof as much as a customer might want it to be large durable and attractive,Irrelevant
The tip of the umbrella that passes through the canopy can be covered with metal a ferrule that has been forced over and perhaps glued to the tip or left bare depending on the desire of the manufacturer,Irrelevant
The handle is connected to the shaft at the end of the process and can be wood plastic metal or any combination of desired ingredients,Relevant
Though handles can be screwed on better quality umbrellas use glue to secure the handle more tightly,Relevant
The end tips of the umbrella where the ribs reach past the canopy can be left bare or covered with small plastic or wood end caps that are either pushed or screwed on or glued and then sewn to the ends of the ribs through small holes in the end caps,Relevant
Finally the umbrella is packaged accordingly and sent to customers,Relevant
The manufacturing process is split into fabrication making parts sub assembly putting parts together to make components and assembly putting the components together to form the final product ,Irrelevant
The fabrication process comprises several different procedures each specific to a particular type of raw materialsheet metal plastic or aluminum,Irrelevant
Once the constituent parts have been made they are assembled major sub assemblies or components include the transmission the pump the spin and wash tubs the balance ring and the painted parts,Relevant
Finally the sub assemblies are put together inside the shell of the washer which is then complete,Relevant
Most sheet metal parts are formed by a machine called a press,Relevant
This name is quite descriptive as the machine actually presses or squeezes a piece of sheet metal between two halves of a mold called a die,Irrelevant
The metal will take the form of the space between the halves of the die,Irrelevant
Because metal in parts shaped by only one die tends to wrinkle crack or tear multiple dies are generally used to form each component,Irrelevant
Where possible the metal is fed directly from a coil into the press,Irrelevant
When this is not possible the metal is cut to length and manually or with larger parts like the cabinet automatically placed into the die,Irrelevant
Plastic parts are formed in an injection molding machine a metal mold with one or more cavities in the shape of the desired part,Relevant
After being heated to its melting point the plastic is forced into the mold under high pressure,Relevant
Next water is passed through the mold to cool and solidify the part,Relevant
The mold is then opened and the part pushed out by ejector pins,Relevant
When you look at a plastic part you often can see small circles created by these pins,Irrelevant
Aluminum transmission parts are formed into a rough shape in a die cast machine which works much like an injection mold except that it does not use pressure,Relevant
The Most of the key componentstransmission motor broke assemblyare housed below the agitator,Relevant
The balance ring is a weighted ring that keeps the washer from moving around during operation,Irrelevant
Molten metal is mechanically ladled into the mold and cooled,Relevant
The ensuing rough casting is then given its final shape by various machines which drill holes shave excess metal off critical surfaces or cut metal away from the part,Relevant
The transmission is assembled manually by workers who bolt snap or press tight fit several shafts and gears together,Relevant
Workers then add a metered amount of oil and bolt the unit together,Relevant
The pump is assembled automatically,Relevant
Robots place the impeller and seals in the cover and body and seal the pump,Relevant
Some manufacturers use heat and others vibration which generates heat as a sealant,Relevant
The tub parts are made in presses and the sub assembly is manufactured automatically,Relevant
After being rolled into a drum shape the side is welded,Relevant
The weld is then smoothed out and the drum is placed on a unit called an expander which stretches the tub into its final shape,Relevant
A bottom is then welded onto the drum and this weld is also smoothed,Relevant
If the tub is stainless steel it is polished so it won t snag the clothes,Relevant
Otherwise the tub is dipped in a solution called a ground coat and heated to about 1600 degrees until this coating hardens,Relevant
If the tub will not be visible the wash tub the unit is done,Relevant
If the tub will be visible the spin tub a finish coat is applied following the same procedure used with the ground coat this final coat gives the tub either a white or blue color,Relevant
The balance ring is a large weight that stabilizes the washer,Irrelevant
Its outside structure is plastic with a ring of metal melted into the plastic for strength,Irrelevant
Cement is added and balanced precisely,Relevant
This ring which weighs more than twenty pounds keeps the machine from walking or moving about when it is in use,Irrelevant
Washing machine manufacturers use any one of several painting processes,Irrelevant
One manufacturer uses steel that has been prepainted by the steel manufacturer,Irrelevant
Although cheaper this type of steel does not offer the best rust protection because the cut edges are not painted,Irrelevant
Other companies treat their parts with various chemicals to clean and ready them before applying paint,Irrelevant
In some cases the paint comes in a powder with a flour like consistency,Irrelevant
Mixed with air and given an electrical charge the powder is sprayed on the part which is hung from an overhead conveyor and given an opposite charge so that it and the powder will attract one another,Relevant
After spraying the conveyor moves the part into an oven that melts the paint when the part cools the paint process is completed,Relevant
This process begins with mounting the transmission on the balance ring,Irrelevant
The transmission is set on a bearing that is bolted on the wash tub the wash tub is sitting on a conveyor,Relevant
Another bearing the lower bearing the brake assembly and the drive pulley are put on the end of the transmission,Relevant
Next a pivoting mechanism called the pivot dome and legs are bolted on the assembly to hold all the pieces together,Relevant
Using a hydraulically operated mechanism workers then lift this assembly called the module onto the washer base,Relevant
Springs are added to hold module and base together,Relevant
A seal is added the spin tub is bolted to the transmission inside of the wash tub and its plastic covers are snapped into place,Relevant
A plastic hub which attaches the agitator to the transmission is bolted onto the output end of the transmission shaft,Relevant
Then the agitator is snapped onto the hub,Relevant
The pump and a mounting bracket are now bolted onto the motor which is then fitted with a shield to protect against potential leaks,Relevant
This assembly is bolted to the base of the washing machine and connected to the transmission module with a belt and hoses,Relevant
Next the lid hinges are attached to the lid and the top,Relevant
The top of the washer is bolted to the cabinet with a hinge for easy maintenance,Relevant
A mixing valve to control the mixture of hot and cold is bolted to the back of the cabinet,Relevant
The graphics panel which provides words and pictures to explain the controls is mounted on the control panel the controls themselves are attached from the back,Relevant
The wiring connected as one unit is called a harness,Irrelevant
The harness is clipped to the control connectors at one end and the other end is passed through a hole in the top to be mounted to the motor,Relevant
Because of its large size and weight the cabinet assembly is then placed in the washer by a robot,Relevant
The cabinet is bolted to the base and the controls are snapped together with the mating connectors on the module and motor,Relevant
The drain hose is pulled through the cabinet and a part called the gooseneck is added,Relevant
This part is what gives the hose its hook shape so that it will fasten into the drain,Irrelevant
After being tested the front panel is bolted on and a packet of information and accessories is added,Relevant
The finished unit is crated automatically,Relevant
A machine opens the cardboard box which was flat for shipment and drops it over the washer,Relevant
The top and bottom flaps are simultaneously folded over and glued,Relevant
Then the machine applies pressure on the top and bottom of the crate to make sure the glue sets properly,Relevant
After the glue has set the machine puts a banding strap around the top of the crate to add strength for lift truck transportation the units are carried from the top to reduce the risk of damage ,Relevant
This section will focus on quartz digital watches with LED displays,Irrelevant
Although the assembly of such watches must be performed carefully and methodically the most essential aspects of the manufacturing process are in the manufacture of the components,Irrelevant
The heart of a quartz watch is a tiny sliver of quartz,Irrelevant
The synthetically produced quartz is cut by the manufacturer with a diamond saw and shipped to the watchmaker to use,Relevant
The production of grown quartz is a critical step in the process,Irrelevant
Quartz in a natural form is first loaded into a giant kettle or autoclave the same device used by doctors and dentists to sterilize instruments ,Irrelevant
Hanging from the top of the autoclave are seeds or tiny particles of quartz with the desired crystalline structure,Irrelevant
An alkaline material is pumped into the bottom of the autoclave and the autoclave is heated to a temperature of roughly 750 degrees Fahrenheit 400 degrees Celsius ,Relevant
The natural quartz dissolves in the hot alkaline liquid evaporates and deposits itself on the seeds,Relevant
As it deposits itself it follows the pattern of the crystalline structure of the seeds,Relevant
After about 75 days the chamber can be opened and the newly grown quartz crystals can be removed and cut into the correct proportions,Relevant
Different angles and thicknesses in the cutting lead to predictable rates of oscillation,Irrelevant
The desired rate of oscillation for quartz used in wristwatches is 100 000 megaHertz or 100 000 oscillations per second,Irrelevant
In watch assembly the entire set of crystal and microchips is set onto a circuit board,Relevant
A battery is also installed that generates electricity for the quartz crystal and supplies the power for the LED display,Relevant
To work most effectively the piece of quartz needs to be sealed in a vacuum chamber of one sort or another,Irrelevant
Most commonly the quartz is placed into a sort of capsule with wires attached to both ends so that the capsule can be soldered or otherwise connected to a circuit board,Relevant
The electronic leads generated by a battery through the quartz producing oscillations will go to a microchip that serves as a frequency dividing circuit,Relevant
Microchip manufacture like the quartz is also carried out by the supplier to the watch manufacturer An extensive and complex process making microchips involves chemical and or x ray etching of a microscopic electronic circuit onto a tiny piece of silicon dioxide 4 The oscillation rate of perhaps 100 000 vibrations second is reduced to 1 or 60 or some other more manageable number of oscillations The new pattern of oscillation is then sent to another microchip that functions as a counter decoder driver,Irrelevant
This chip will actually count the oscillations that it receives,Relevant
If there are sixty oscillations per second the chip will change the reading on an LED every second,Irrelevant
After 3 600 oscillations 60 x 60 the counter will instruct the LED to change the reading for minutes,Irrelevant
And after 60 x 60 x 60 oscillations 216 000 the counter will change the hour reading,Irrelevant
The entire set of crystal and microchips is set onto a circuit board,Relevant
The board incorporates a space to hold the battery that supplies electricity to the quartz crystal and supplies the power for the LED display,Relevant
Generally the space for the battery is on the outside of the surface facing the back of the case,Irrelevant
The battery can be replaced by removing the back of the watch shaking out the old one and dropping in the new battery,Irrelevant
The mechanism used for setting the watch is then connected,Irrelevant
This mechanism involves two pins that extend beyond the case of the watch,Irrelevant
One pin lets the counter circuit know which reading to resetseconds minutes or hours,Irrelevant
The second pin is pushed a number of times to bring the display to the desired reading,Irrelevant
The entire circuit board along with a battery is then closed into a case and a wrist strap is attached,Relevant
Before consideration can be given to the construction of individual wind turbines manufacturers must determine a proper area for the siting of wind farms,Irrelevant
Winds must be consistent and their speed must be regularly over 15 5 miles per hour 25 kilometers per hour ,Irrelevant
If the winds are stronger during certain seasons it is preferred that they be greatest during periods of maximum electricity use,Irrelevant
In California s Altamont Pass for instance site of the world s largest wind farm wind speed peaks in the summer when demand is high,Irrelevant
In some areas of New England where wind farms are being considered winds are strongest in the winter when the need for heating increases the consumption of electrical power,Irrelevant
Wind farms work best in open areas of slightly rolling land surrounded by mountains,Irrelevant
These areas are preferred because the wind turbines can be placed on ridges and remain unobstructed by trees and buildings and the mountains concentrate the air flow creating a natural wind tunnel of stronger faster winds,Irrelevant
Wind farms must also be placed near utility lines to facilitate the transfer of the electricity to the local power plant,Irrelevant
The nacelle is a strong hollow shell that contains the inner workings of the wind turbine such as the main drive shaft and the gearbox,Irrelevant
It also contains the blade pitch control a hydraulic system that controls the angle of the blades and the yaw drive which controls the position of the turbine relative to the wind,Irrelevant
A typical nacelle for a current turbine weighs approximately 22 000 pounds,Irrelevant
Wherever a wind farm is to be built the roads are cut to make way for transporting parts,Relevant
At each wind turbine location the land is graded and the pad area is leveled,Relevant
A concrete foundation is then laid into the ground followed by the installation of the underground cables,Relevant
These cables connect the wind turbines to each other in series and also connect all of them to the remote control center where the wind farm is monitored and the electricity is sent to the power company,Relevant
Although the tower s steel parts are manufactured off site in a factory they are usually assembled on site,Relevant
The parts are bolted together before erection and the tower is kept horizontal until placement,Relevant
A crane lifts the tower into position all bolts are tightened and stability is tested upon completion,Relevant
The fiberglass nacelle like the tower is manufactured off site in a factory,Irrelevant
Unlike the tower however it is also put together in the factory,Irrelevant
Its inner workingsmain drive shaft gearbox and blade pitch and yaw controlsare assembled and then mounted onto a base frame,Irrelevant
The nacelle is then bolted The utility box for each wind turbine and the electrical communication system for the wind farm is installed simultaneously with the placement of the nacelle and blades,Relevant
Cables run from the nacelle to the utility box and from the utility box to the remote control center,Irrelevant
The utility box for each wind turbine and the electrical communication system for the wind farm is installed simultaneously with the placement of the nacelle and blades,Relevant
Cables run from the nacelle to the utility box and from the utility box to the remote control center around the equipment,Relevant
At the site the nacelle is lifted onto the completed tower and bolted into place,Relevant
Aluminum blades are created by bolting sheets of aluminum together while wooden blades are carved to form an aerodynamic propeller similar in cross section to an airplane wing,Relevant
By far the greatest number of blades however are formed from fiberglass,Irrelevant
The manufacture of fiberglass is a painstaking operation,Irrelevant
First a mold that is in two halves like a clam shell yet shaped like a blade is prepared,Relevant
Next a fiberglass resin composite mixture is applied to the inner surfaces of the mold which is then closed,Relevant
The fiberglass mixture must then dry for several hours while it does an air filled bladder within the mold helps the blade keep its shape,Relevant
After the fiberglass is dry the mold is then opened and the bladder is removed,Relevant
Final preparation of the blade involves cleaning sanding sealing the two halves and painting,Relevant
The blades are usually bolted onto the nacelle after it has been placed onto the tower,Irrelevant
Because assembly is easier to accomplish on the ground occasionally a three pronged blade has two blades bolted onto the nacelle before it is lifted and the third blade is bolted on after the nacelle is in place,Irrelevant
The utility box for each wind turbine and the electrical communication system for the wind farm is installed simultaneously with the placement of the nacelle and blades,Relevant
The process of wine production has remained much the same throughout the ages but new sophisticated machinery and technology have helped streamline and increase the output of wine,Irrelevant
Whether such advances have enhanced the quality of wine is however a subject of debate,Irrelevant
These advances include a variety of mechanical harvesters grape crushers temperature controlled tanks and centrifuges,Irrelevant
The procedures involved in creating wine are often times dictated by the grape and the amount and type of wine being produced,Irrelevant
Recipes for certain types of wine require the winemaker the vintner to monitor and regulate the amount of yeast the fermentation process and other steps of the process,Irrelevant
While the manufacturing process is highly automated in medium to large sized wineries small wineries still use hand operated presses and store wine in musty wine cellars,Irrelevant
A universal factor in the production of fine wine is timing,Irrelevant
This includes picking grapes at the right time removing the must at the right time monitoring and regulating fermentation and storing the wine long enough,Irrelevant
The wine making process can be divided into four distinct steps harvesting and crushing grapes fermenting must ageing the wine and packaging,Irrelevant
Vineyardists inspect sample clusters of wine grapes with a refractometer to determine if the grapes are ready to be picked,Relevant
The refractometer is a small hand held device the size of a miniature telescope that allows the vineyardist to accurately check the amount of sugar in the grapes,Irrelevant
If the grapes are ready for picking a mechanical harvester usually a suction picker gathers and funnels the grapes into a field hopper or mobile storage container,Irrelevant
Some mechanical harvesters have grape crushers mounted on the machinery allowing vineyard workers to gather grapes and press them at the same time,Irrelevant
The result is that vineyards can deliver newly crushed grapes called must to wineries eliminating the need for crushing at the winery,Irrelevant
This also prevents oxidization of the juice through tears or splits in the grapes skins,Irrelevant
Mechanical harvesters or in some cases robots are now used in most medium to large vineyards thereby eliminating the need for hand picking,Irrelevant
First used in California vineyards in 1968 mechanical harvesters have significantly decreased the time it takes to gather grapes,Irrelevant
The harvesters have also allowed grapes to be gathered at night when they are cool fresh and ripe,Relevant
The field hoppers are transported to the winery where they are unloaded into a crusher stemmer machine,Relevant
Some crusher stemmer machines are hydraulic while others are driven by air pressure,Irrelevant
The grapes are crushed and the stems are removed leaving liquid must that flows either into a stainless steel fermentation tank or a wooden vat for fine wines ,Relevant
Once at the winery the grapes are crushed if necessary and the must is fermented settled clarified and filtered,Relevant
After filtering the wine is aged in stainless steel tanks or wooden vats,Relevant
White and rose wines may age for a year to four years or far less than a year,Irrelevant
For white wine all the grape skins are separated from the must by filters or centrifuges before the must undergoes fermentation,Relevant
For red wine the whole crushed grape including the skin goes into the fermentation tank or vat,Relevant
The pigment in the grape skins give red wine its color,Irrelevant
The amount of time the skins are left in the tank or vat determines how dark or light the color will be,Relevant
For rose the skins only stay in the tank or vat for a short time before they are filtered out,Relevant
During the fermentation process wild yeast are fed into the tank or vat to turn the sugar in the must into alcohol,Relevant
To add strength varying degrees of yeast may be added,Irrelevant
In addition cane or beet sugar may be added to increase the alcoholic content,Relevant
Adding sugar is call chaptalization,Irrelevant
Usually chaptalization is done because the grapes have not received enough sun prior to harvesting,Irrelevant
The winemaker will use a handheld hydrometer to measure the sugar content in the tank or vat,Irrelevant
The wine must ferments in the tank or vat for approximately seven to fourteen days depending on the type of wine being produced,Irrelevant
After crushing and fermentation wine needs to be stored filtered and properly aged,Relevant
In some instances the wine must also be blended with other alcohol,Irrelevant
Many wineries still store wine in damp subterranean wine cellars to keep the wine cool but larger wineries now store wine above ground in epoxylined and stainless steel tanks,Irrelevant
The tanks are temperature controlled by water that circulates inside the lining of the tank shell,Irrelevant
Other similar tanks are used instead of the old redwood and concrete vats when wine is temporarily stored during the settling process,Irrelevant
After fermentation certain wines mainly red wine will be crushed again and pumped into another fermentation tank where the wine will ferment again for approximately three to seven days,Relevant
This is done not only to extend the wine s shelf life but also to ensure clarity and color stability,Irrelevant
The wine is then pumped into settling racking tanks or vats,Relevant
The wine will remain in the tank for one to two months,Relevant
Typically racking is done at 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit 10 to 16 degrees Celsius for red wine and 32 degrees Fahrenheit 0 degrees Celsius for white wine,Irrelevant
After the initial settling racking process certain wines are pumped into another settling tank or vat where the wine remains for another two to three months,Relevant
During settling the weighty unwanted debris remaining stem pieces etc settle to the bottom of the tank and are eliminated when the wine is pumped into another tank,Relevant
The settling process creates smoother wine,Relevant
Additional settling may be necessary for certain wines,Irrelevant
After the settling process the wine passes through a number of filters or centrifuges where the wine is stored at low temperatures or where clarifying substances trickle through the wine,Relevant
After various filtering processes the wine is aged in stainless steel tanks or wooden vats,Relevant
Red wines may age for seven to ten years,Irrelevant
Most large wineries age their wine in large temperature controlled stainless steel tanks that are above ground while smaller wineries may still store their wine in wooden barrels in damp wine cellars,Irrelevant
The wine is then filtered one last time to remove unwanted sediment,Relevant
The wine is now ready to be bottled corked sealed crated labeled and shipped to distributors,Irrelevant
Most medium to large sized wineries I now use automated bottling machines and most moderately priced and expensive wine bottles have corks made of a special oak,Irrelevant
The corks are covered with a peel off aluminum foil or plastic seal,Relevant
Cheaper wines have an aluminum screw off cap or plastic stopper,Irrelevant
The corks and screw caps keep the air from spoiling the wine,Irrelevant
Wine is usually shipped in wooden crates though cheaper wines may be packaged in cardboard,Irrelevant
The major steps necessary to process wool from the sheep to the fabric are shearing cleaning and scouring grading and sorting carding spinning weaving and finishing,Irrelevant
Sheep are sheared once a yearusually in the springtime,Relevant
A veteran shearer can shear up to two hundred sheep per day,Irrelevant
The fleece recovered from a sheep can weigh between 6 and 18 pounds 2 7 and 8 1 kilograms as much as possible the fleece is kept in one piece,Irrelevant
While most sheep are still sheared by hand new technologies have been developed that use computers and sensitive robot controlled arms to do the clipping,Irrelevant
Grading is the breaking up of the fleece based on overall quality,Irrelevant
In sorting the wool is broken up into sections of different quality fibers from different parts of the body,Relevant
The best quality of wool comes from the shoulders and sides of the sheep and is used for clothing the lesser quality comes from the lower legs and is used to make rugs,Irrelevant
In wool grading high quality does not always mean high durability,Irrelevant
Wool taken directly from the sheep is called raw or grease wool,Irrelevant
It contains sand dirt grease and dried sweat called suint the weight of contaminants accounts for about 30 to 70 percent of the After being carded the wool fibers are spun into yarn,Irrelevant
After the yarn is spun it is wrapped around bobbins cones or commercial drums,Relevant
After being carded the wool fibers are spun into yarn,Relevant
Spinning for woolen yarns is typically done on a mule spinning machine while worsted yarns can be spun on any number of spinning machines,Irrelevant
After the yarn is spun it is wrapped around bobbins cones or commercial drums fleece s total weight,Relevant
To remove these contaminants the wool is scoured in a series of alkaline baths containing water soap and soda ash or a similar alkali,Relevant
The byproducts from this process such as lanolin are saved and used in a variety of household products,Relevant
Rollers in the scouring machines squeeze excess water from the fleece but the fleece is not allowed to dry completely,Relevant
Following this process the wool is often treated with oil to give it increased manageability,Relevant
Next the fibers are passed through a series of metal teeth that straighten and blend them into slivers,Relevant
Carding also removes residual dirt and other matter left in the fibers,Relevant
Carded wool intended for worsted yarn is put through gilling and combing two procedures that remove short fibers and place the longer fibers parallel to each other,Relevant
From there the sleeker slivers are compacted and thinned through a process called drawing,Relevant
Carded wool to be used for woolen yarn is sent directly for spinning,Relevant
Thread is formed by spinning the fibers together to form one strand of yarn the strand is spun with two three or four other strands,Irrelevant
Since the fibers cling and stick to one another it is fairly easy to join extend and spin wool into yarn,Irrelevant
Next the wool yarn is woven into fabric,Relevant
Wool manufacturers use two basic weaves the plain weave and the twill,Irrelevant
Woolen yarns are made into fabric using a plain weave rarely a twill which produces a fabric of a somewhat looser weave and a soft surface due to napping with little or no luster,Relevant
The napping often conceals flaws in construction,Relevant
Worsted yarns can create fine fabrics with exquisite patterns using a twill weave,Irrelevant
The result is a more tightly woven smooth fabric,Irrelevant
Better constructed worsteds are more durable than woolens and therefore more costly,Irrelevant
After weaving both worsteds and woolens undergo a series of finishing procedures including fulling immersing the fabric in water to make the fibers interlock crabbing permanently setting the interlock decating shrink proofing and occasionally dyeing,Relevant
Although wool fibers can be dyed before the carding process dyeing can also be done after the wool has been woven into fabric,Relevant
Today s zippers comprise key components of either metal or plastic,Irrelevant
Beyond this one very important difference the steps involved in producing the finished product are essentially the same,Irrelevant
A stringer consists of the tape or cloth and teeth that make up one side of the zipper,Irrelevant
The oldest process for making the stringers for a metal zipper is that process invented by Otto Sundback in 1923,Irrelevant
A round wire is sent through a rolling mill shaping it into a Y shape,Relevant
This wire is then sliced to form a tooth whose width is appropriate for the type of zipper desired,Relevant
The tooth is then put into a slot on a rotating turntable to be punched into the shape of a scoop by a die,Relevant
The turntable is rotated 90 degrees and another tooth is fed into the slot,Relevant
After another 90 degrees turn the first tooth is clamped onto the cloth tape,Relevant
The tape must be raised slightly over twice the thickness of the scoopthe cupped toothafter clamping to allow room for the opposite tooth on the completed zipper,Relevant
A slow and tedious process its popularity has waned,Irrelevant
To make the stringer for a spiral plastic zipper a round plastic wire is notched and then fed between two heated screws,Irrelevant
These screws one rotating clockwise the other counterclockwise pull the plastic wire out to form loops,Irrelevant
Another similar method originated in the 1940s,Irrelevant
This entails a flattened strip of wire passing between a heading punch and a pocket punch to form scoops,Relevant
A blanking punch cuts around the scoops to form a Y shape,Relevant
The legs of the Y are then clamped around the cloth tape,Relevant
This method proved to be faster and more effective than Sundback s original,Irrelevant
Yet another method developed in the 1930s uses molten metal to form teeth,Irrelevant
A mold shaped like a chain of teeth is clamped around the cloth tape,Irrelevant
Molten zinc under pressure is then injected into the mold,Relevant
Water cools the mold which then releases the shaped teeth,Relevant
Any residue is trimmed,Relevant
Plastic zippers can be spiral toothed ladder or woven directly into the fabric,Irrelevant
Two methods are used to make the stringers for a spiral plastic zipper,Irrelevant
The first involves notching a round plastic wire before feeding it between two heated screws,Relevant
These screws one rotating clockwise the other counter clockwise pull the plastic wire out to form loops,Relevant
A head maker at the front of each loop then forms it into a round knob,Relevant
Next the plastic spiral is cooled with air,Relevant
This method requires that a left spiral and right spiral be made simultaneously on two separate machines so that the chains will match up on a finished zipper,Irrelevant
The second method for spiral plastic zippers makes both the left and right spiral simultaneously on one machine,Irrelevant
A piece of wire is looped twice between notches on a rotating forming wheel,Relevant
A pusher and head maker simultaneously press the plastic wires firmly into the notches and form the heads,Relevant
This process makes two chains that are already linked together to be sewn onto two cloth tapes,Relevant
To make the stringers for a toothed plastic zipper a molding process is used that is similar to the metal process described in step #2 above,Relevant
A rotating wheel has on its edge several small molds that are shaped like flattened teeth,Relevant
Two cords run through the molds to connect the finished teeth together,Relevant
Semi molten plastic is fed into the mold where it is held until it solidifies,Relevant
A folding machine bends the teeth into a U shape that can be sewn onto a cloth tape,Relevant
The stringers for a ladder plastic zipper are made by winding a plastic wire onto alternating spools that protrude from the edge of a rotating forming wheel,Irrelevant
Strippers on each side lift the loops off the spools while a heading and notching wheel simultaneously presses the loops into a U shape and forms heads on the teeth which are then sewn onto the cloth tape,Irrelevant
Superior garment zippers can be made by weaving the plastic wire directly into the cloth using the same method as is used in cloth weaving,Irrelevant
This method is not common in the United States but such zippers are frequently imported,Irrelevant
Once the individual stringers have been made they are first joined together with a temporary device similar to a slider,Relevant
They are then pressed and in the case of metal zippers wire brushes scrub down sharp edges,Relevant
The tapes are then starched wrung out and dried,Relevant
Metal zippers are then waxed for smooth operation and both types are rolled onto huge spools to be formed later into complete zippers,Relevant
The slider and pull tab are assembled separately after being stamped or die cast from metal,Relevant
The continuous zipper tape is then unrolled from its spool and its teeth are removed at intervals leaving spaces that surround smaller chains,Relevant
For zippers that only open on one end the bottom stop is first clamped on and then the slider is threaded onto the chain,Relevant
Next the top stops are clamped on and the gaps between lengths of teeth are cut at midpoint,Relevant
For zippers that separate the midpoint of each gap is coated with reinforcing tape and the top stops are clamped on,Relevant
The tape is then sliced to separate the strips of chain again,Relevant
The slider and the box are then slipped onto one chain and the pin is slipped onto the other,Relevant
The basic elements of a zipper are the stringer the tape and teeth assembly that makes up one side of a zipper the slider opens and closes the zipper a tab pulled to move the slider and stops prevent the slider from leaving the chain ,Irrelevant
Finished zippers are stacked placed in boxes and trucked to clothing manufacturers luggage manufacturers or any of the other manufacturers that rely on zippers,Relevant
Some are also shipped to department stores or fabric shops for direct purchase by the consumer,Relevant
The sand and gravel that contain zircon mixed with silicate ilmenite and rutile are typically collected from coastal waters by a floating dredge a large steam shovel fitted on a floating barge,Relevant
After the shovel has scooped up the gravel and sand they are purified by means of spiral concentrators which separate on the basis of density,Relevant
The ilmenite and rutile are then removed by magnetic and electrostatic separators,Relevant
The purest concentrates of zircon are shipped to end product manufacturers to be used in metal production while less pure concentrations are used for refractories,Relevant
End product manufacturers of zircon further refine the nearly pure zircon into zirconium by using a reducing agent usually chlorine to purify the metal and then sintering heating it until it becomes sufficiently ductileworkablefor industrial use,Relevant
For small scale laboratory use zirconium metal may be produced by means of a chemical reaction in which chloride is used to reduce the zircon,Relevant
The less pure zircon is made into zirconia an oxide of zirconium by fusing the zircon with coke iron borings and lime until the silica is reduced to silicon that alloys with the iron,Relevant
The zirconia is then stabilized by heating it to about 3 095 degrees Fahrenheit 1 700 degrees Celsius with additions of lime and magnesia totalling about five percent,Relevant
As mentioned above baddeleyite contains relatively high pure concentrations of zirconium oxide that can be used without filtering or cleansing,Irrelevant
The only refining process used on baddeleyite involves grinding the gravel or sand to a powder and sizing the powder with different sized sieves,Relevant
All zirconium oxide that comes from baddeleyite is used for refractories and increasingly advanced ceramics,Relevant
The mold for producing sheets is assembled from two plates of polished glass separated by a flexible window frame spacer,Relevant
The spacer sits along the outer perimeter of the surface of the glass plates and forms a sealed cavity between the plates,Relevant
The fact that the spacer is flexible allows the mold cavity to shrink during the polymerization process to compensate for the volume contraction of the material as the reaction goes from individual molecules to linked polymers,Irrelevant
In some production applications polished metal plates are used instead of glass,Irrelevant
Several plates may be stacked on top of each other with the upper surface of one plate becoming the bottom surface of the next higher mold cavity,Relevant
The plates and spacers are clamped together with spring clamps,Relevant
An open comer of each mold cavity is filled with a pre measured liquid syrup of methyl methacrylate monomer and catalyst,Relevant
In some cases a methyl methacrylate prepolymer is also added,Irrelevant
A prepolymer is a material with partially formed polymer chains used to further help the polymerization process,Irrelevant
The liquid syrup flows throughout the mold cavity to fill it,Relevant
The mold is then sealed and heat may be applied to help the catalyst start the reaction,Irrelevant
As the reaction proceeds it may generate significant heat by itself,Irrelevant
This heat is fanned off in air ovens or by placing the molds in a water bath,Relevant
A programmed temperature cycle is followed to ensure proper cure time without additional vaporization of the monomer solution,Relevant
This also prevents bubbles from forming,Irrelevant
Thinner sheets may cure in 10 to 12 hours but thicker sheets may require several days,Irrelevant
When the plastic is cured the molds are cooled and opened,Relevant
The glass or metal plates are cleaned and reassembled for the next batch,Relevant
The plastic sheets are either used as is or are annealed by heating them to 284 302 F 140 150 C for several hours to reduce any residual stresses in the material that might cause warping or other dimensional instabilities,Relevant
Any excess material or flash is trimmed off the edges and masking paper or plastic film is applied to the surface of the finished sheets for protection during handling and shipping,Relevant
The paper or film is often marked with the material s brand name size and handling instructions,Relevant
Conformance with applicable safety or building code standards is also noted,Relevant
The continuous process is similar to the batch cell process but because the sheets are thinner and smaller the process times are much shorter,Irrelevant
The syrup of monomer and catalyst is introduced at one end of a set of horizontal stainless steel belts running parallel one above the other,Relevant
The distance between the belts determines the thickness of the sheet to be formed,Irrelevant
The belts hold the reacting monomer and catalyst syrup between them and move it through a series of heating and cooling zones according to a programmed temperature cycle to cure the material,Relevant
Electric heaters or hot air may then anneal the material as it comes out of the end of the belts,Irrelevant
The sheets are cut to size and masking paper or plastic film is applied,Relevant
The modern method for making aluminum beverage cans is called two piece drawing and wall ironing,Irrelevant
The process begins with an aluminum ingot which was cast to be about 30 inches 76 cm thick then rolled into a thin sheet,Relevant
The first step in the actual manufacture of the can is to cut the sheet into a circle called a blank that will form the bottom and sides of the can,Relevant
Each blank is 5 5 inches 14 cm in diameter,Irrelevant
Some material is necessarily lost between each circle but manufacturers have found that minimum aluminum is lost when the sheets are wide enough to hold two staggered rows of seven blanks each,Irrelevant
About 12 14% of the sheet is wasted but can be reused as scrap,Irrelevant
After the circular blank is cut it is drawn or pulled up to form a cup 3 5 inches 8 9 cm in diameter,Relevant
The small ripples at the top of the metal are called ears ,Irrelevant
Earing is an unavoidable effect of the crystalline structure of the aluminum sheet,Irrelevant
The small cup resulting from the initial draw is then transferred to a second machine,Relevant
A sleeve holds the cup precisely in place and a punch lowered swiftly into the cup redraws it to a diameter of about 2 6 inches 6 6 cm ,Relevant
The height of the cup increases simultaneously from the initial 1 3 to 2 25 inches 3 3 to 5 7 cm ,Irrelevant
The punch then pushes the cup against three rings called ironing rings which stretch and thin the cup walls,Relevant
This entire operationthe drawing and ironingis done in one continuous punch stroke which takes only one fifth of a second to complete,Irrelevant
The cup is now about 5 inches 13 cm high,Irrelevant
Then another punch presses up against the base of the cup causing the bottom to bulge inward,Irrelevant
This shape counteracts the pressure of the carbonated liquid the can will contain,Relevant
The bottom and lower walls of the can are also a little thicker than the upper walls for added strength,Irrelevant
The drawing and ironing process leaves the can slightly wavy at the top,Irrelevant
These small ripples in the metal are called ears,Irrelevant
Earing is an unavoidable effect of the crystalline structure of the aluminum sheet,Irrelevant
Aluminum companies have studied this phenomenon extensively and they have been able to influence the placement and height of the ears by controlling the rolling of the aluminum sheet,Irrelevant
Nevertheless some material is lost at this stage,Irrelevant
About a quarter inch is trimmed from the top of the can leaving the upper walls straight and level,Irrelevant
The drawing and ironing process leaves the outer wall of the can with a smooth shiny surface so it does not require any further finishing such as polishing,Irrelevant
After the ears are trimmed the can is cleaned and then imprinted with its label,Relevant
After the can is decorated it is squeezed in slightly at the top to a make a neck and the neck is given an out ward flange at the very top edge which will be folded over once the lid is added,Relevant
The lid is made of a slightly different alloy than the aluminum for the base and sides of the can,Irrelevant
The inward bulge of the bottom of the can helps it withstand the pressure exerted by the liquid inside it but the flat lid must be stiffer and stronger than the base so it is made of aluminum with more magnesium and less manganese than the rest of the can,Irrelevant
This results in stronger metal and the lid is considerably thicker than the walls,Irrelevant
The lid is cut to a diameter of 2 1 inches 5 3 cm smaller than the 2 6 inch 6 6 cm diameter of the walls,Relevant
The center of the lid is stretched upward slightly and drawn by a machine to form a rivet,Relevant
The pull tab a separate piece of metal is inserted under the rivet and secured by it,Relevant
Then the lid is scored so that when the tab is pulled by the consumer the metal will detach easily and leave the proper opening,Relevant
To ensure that the cans are made properly they are automatically checked for cracks and pinholes,Relevant
One in 50 000 cans is usually found to be defective,Irrelevant
After the neck is formed the can is ready to be filled,Relevant
The can is held tightly against the seat of a filling machine and a beverage is poured in,Relevant
The lid is added,Relevant
The upper flange formed when the can was given its neck is then bent around the lid and seamed shut,Relevant
At this point the can is ready for sale,Relevant
The assembly process for the cartridge components begins with a thorough cleaning and polishing of the case by a vibratory finisher,Relevant
The finisher works by vibrating a corn byproduct dried and ground corncobs with a polishing compound around the cases creating a high luster,Relevant
Thus prepared they are ready for final assembly,Irrelevant
This is how a typical center fire metal cartridge is assembled 1 The cases are fed into a loading press which first sizes the case,Relevant
This sizing Ammunitionforms the metal case to standard dimensions,Irrelevant
The case must be within 0 001 inch for it to function correctly,Irrelevant
The primer is then pressed into the case primer hole flush with the base,Relevant
The primer must be flush or the cartridge will not feed properly in the weapon magazine causing a jam,Irrelevant
At the same time the mouth of the case is slightly expanded in preparation for receiving the bullet 3 The case is charged or filled with the correct amount of propellant,Irrelevant
This step is of utmost importance for miscalculation or double charging could be disastrous,Irrelevant
The bullet is firmly seated into the open end of the case,Relevant
The bullet has a coating of lubricant to prevent corrosion and assist in the assembly process,Relevant
The bullet is then crimped into the case to give the correct overall length of the cartridge,Relevant
The crimp reduces the diameter of the open end of the case and captures the bullet tightly sealing the assembly together so moisture cannot invade the powder,Irrelevant
The press used to assemble cartridges must feed each component accurately and in the correct sequence,Irrelevant
Otherwise cases could be unprimed powder left out or bullets seated incorrectly,Irrelevant
Any of these could result in a misfire or loss of accuracy at the minimum and at worst cause the firearm to blow apart upon firing,Irrelevant
In each stage of the process special dies perform the important assembly function,Relevant
The dies are made of tooling carbide for long life and have close adjustments to produce quality ammunition,Irrelevant
After assembly the finished cartridges are packaged usually 50 to a box and prepared for shipment to the shooter,Relevant
The manufacturing process for antilock brake systems consists of manufacturing the component parts and then installing those parts on the vehicle,Irrelevant
The parts are built in one plant then packaged and shipped to a vehicle assembly plant for installation,Irrelevant
This is a typical process for an automobile antilock brake system,Irrelevant
The master cylinder including the base for the solenoid body is cast as a single unit,Irrelevant
The seating and sealing surfaces are machined smooth and the connection ports are threaded,Irrelevant
The individual primary and secondary pistons solenoid coils reservoir caps and seals pressure accumulator and any metering and proportioning valves are installed,Irrelevant
The solenoid body has a cover which attaches to the master cylinder with four or more screws and is sealed with a gasket,Irrelevant
The toothed wheel is cast from iron,Irrelevant
Minor machining may be required at the mounting points,Irrelevant
The pick up coils are wound around the permanent magnet core in a machine called a coil winder,Irrelevant
The entire assembly is encased or potted in plastic resin with an electrical connector attached,Irrelevant
The electronic controller components are soldered to a printed circuit board,Irrelevant
The board is connected inside a protective housing and mounted to the cast aluminum heat sink base,Irrelevant
Extemal electrical connections are provided for the input wiring from each speed sensor and the out put wiring to the solenoids in the master brake cylinder,Irrelevant
In the automobile assembly plant the steel tubing brake lines are installed in the framework of the body,Irrelevant
They run from the partition between the engine compartment and the occupant compartment called the firewall to the vicinity of each wheel,Irrelevant
The electrical wires for the ABS are also run from the vicinity of each wheel to the controller location and from the controller to the firewall,Irrelevant
The brake master cylinder is bolted to the firewall in the engine compartment near the brake pedal,Relevant
The brake lines are attached to the appropriate ports on the solenoid body and the electrical wires are connected,Relevant
The toothed sensor wheels are pressed onto the outer constant velocity joints or the ends of the axle spindles so that they ride just inside the wheels,Relevant
Once the axles are attached to the frame the brake lines are attached and the pick up coils are installed so that the end of the coils are close to the toothed wheels,Relevant
The pick up coils are then electrically connected to the wires to the controller,Irrelevant
The controller is installed either under the instrument panel or in the vehicle s trunk,Relevant
The electrical connections are made including the power connection from the vehicle battery through the fuse box,Relevant
The refining process starts by piping the crude petroleum from a storage tank into a heat exchanger or tube heater where its temperature is rapidly raised for initial distillation,Relevant
It then enters an atmospheric distillation tower where the lighter and more volatile components or fractions vaporize and are drawn off through a series of condensers and coolers,Relevant
It is then separated for further refining into gasoline considered a light distillate kerosene considered a medium distillate diesel oil considered a heavy distillate and many other useful petroleum products,Relevant
The heavy residue from this atmospheric distillation process is commonly called topped crude,Irrelevant
This topped crude may be used for fuel oil or further processed into other products such as asphalt,Irrelevant
Vacuum distillation may remove enough high boiling fractions to yield what is called a straight run asphalt,Irrelevant
However if the topped crude contains enough low volatile components which cannot be economically removed through distillation solvent extractionalso known as solvent deasphaltingmay be required to produce asphalt cement of the desired consistency,Irrelevant
Asphalt may next be blended or cut back with a volatile substance resulting in a product that is soft and workable at a lower temperature than pure asphalt cement,Relevant
When the cut back asphalt is used for paving or construction the volatile element evaporates when exposed to air or heat leaving the hard asphalt cement,Relevant
The relative speed of evaporation or volatility of the cutting agent determines whether a cutback asphalt is classified as slow medium or rapid curing,Relevant
Heated asphalt cement is mixed with residual asphaltic oil from the earlier distillation process for a slow curing asphalt with kerosene for medium curing and with gasoline or naphtha for the rapid curing asphalt,Relevant
The asphalt cement may also be emulsified to produce a liquid that can be easily pumped through pipes mixed with aggregate or sprayed through nozzles,Relevant
To emulsify the asphalt cement is ground into globules 5 to 10 microns and smaller one micron is equal to one millionth of a meter ,Relevant
This is mixed with water,Relevant
An emulsifying agent is added which reduces the tendency of the asphalt and water to separate,Relevant
The emulsifying agent may be colloidal clay soluble or insoluble silicates soap or sulphonated vegetable oils,Relevant
Asphalt may also be pulverized to produce a powdered asphalt,Relevant
The asphalt is crushed and passed through a series of fine mesh sieves to ensure uniform size of the granules,Relevant
Powered asphalt can be mixed with road oil and aggregate for pavement construction,Relevant
The heat and pressure in the road slowly amalgamates the powder with the aggregate and binding oil and the Asphalt Cementsubstance hardens to a consistency similar to regular asphalt cement,Irrelevant
If the asphalt is to be used for a purpose other than paving such as roofing pipe coating or as an undersealant or water proofing material the asphalt may be oxidized or air blown,Irrelevant
This process produces a material that softens at a higher temperature than paving asphalts,Irrelevant
It may be air blown at the refinery at an asphalt processing plant or at a roofing material plant,Irrelevant
The asphalt is heated to 500 F 260 C ,Relevant
Then air is bubbled through it for one to 4 5 hours,Relevant
When cooled the asphalt remains liquid,Relevant
Prior to its use the latex may need to be colored,Irrelevant
This involves mixing a pigment into the latex,Relevant
It may be done at the balloon factory or the balloon maker may purchase already pigmented latex from a supplier,Irrelevant
The latex must be poured into tanks into which the forms will be dipped,Relevant
The tanks are kept at a certain temperature and may include stirring mechanisms to keep the latex circulating to avoid settling,Irrelevant
The balloon forms are first heated then immersed in a tank of coagulant solution for a few seconds,Relevant
When the forms are immersed in the liquid latex the coagulant will cause the rubber to gel in a thin sheet around the forms,Irrelevant
A commonly used coagulant solution is a mixture of water a calcium based salt soap and talc powder,Relevant
The salt is the actual coagulant the soap helps the latex spread in an even film and the talc helps ease the removal of the rubber from the forms in a later step,Irrelevant
The forms are heated to a temperature between 100 F 38 C and 200 F 93 C and then immersed in a tank of colored latex,Relevant
The coagulant causes the latex to coat the forms,Relevant
The longer the forms are left in the tank the thicker the coating that sticks to them,Relevant
For balloons a very thin layer of latex is desired so the forms are immersed only for a few seconds,Irrelevant
The forms must be inserted and removed at carefully controlled speeds to avoid trapping air bubbles and to achieve an even thin coating,Irrelevant
A lip is formed on the neck of the balloon by rolling the edges of the rubber using brushes or rollers,Relevant
This creates the ring seen around the opening of the balloon,Relevant
Next the forms are immersed in a tank of leaching solution often plain water to dissolve and leach away excess coagulant from the rubber,Relevant
The rubber on the forms must be dried and cured,Relevant
The method used varies among manufacturers,Irrelevant
Some balloon makers use a latex that already contains a vulcanizing agent in which case the rubber is dried at a moderate temperature,Irrelevant
Other makers induce vulcanization by putting the rubber coated forms into an oven and curing for as long as an hour,Irrelevant
The balloons are then mechanically removed from their forms,Relevant
One approach is to blow them off using a spray of water or air and collecting the balloons in a basket or net,Irrelevant
If the balloons are removed using a spray of water they are next placed in a centrifuge where excess water is removed by spinning the balloons around at high speed,Irrelevant
The balloons are then dried in large tumble dryers,Relevant
Next the balloons may either be packaged or first printed and then packaged,Relevant
If they are packaged directly they are moved on a conveyor belt past a counting device and placed into bags,Relevant
When an appropriate number of balloons has been placed in each bag the bags are sealed,Relevant
Printing designs on balloons such as logos or faces actually involves several steps,Irrelevant
First the balloons must be inflated in order to allow even printing,Relevant
This requires a worker to manually place each balloon on the inflating device,Relevant
Next a pattern is carefully printed on each balloon,Relevant
Finally the balloons are removed and passed on to the packaging stage,Relevant
Iron ore coke and limestone are heated in a blast furnace by hot pressurized air,Relevant
The coke produces heat to melt the iron ore and carbon monoxide which reacts with iron oxides in the ore to release iron ,Irrelevant
The limestone reacts with impurities in the iron ore such as sulfur to form slag which is removed,Irrelevant
The final product of the blast furnace is pig iron which contains at least 90% iron 3 5% carbon and various impurities,Irrelevant
To convert pig iron into steel the impurities and most of the carbon must be removed,Irrelevant
Iron without carbon is much weaker than steel but iron with too much carbon is brittle ,Irrelevant
Various methods exist to purify pig iron the most common of which is the basic oxygen steel BOS process,Irrelevant
In this method oxygen is blasted into molten pig iron under high pressure,Relevant
Carbon is released as carbon monoxide and the impurities are released as slag,Relevant
The remaining molten steel is poured into molds and allowed to cool into ingots weighing thousands of pounds each,Relevant
A billet is a bar of steel with a square cross section whose dimensions are usually less than about 6 inches 15 cm by 6 inches 15 cm ,Relevant
If the dimensions are larger the bar is known as a bloom if the cross section is rectangular rather than square the bar is known as a slab ,Irrelevant
A steel ingot is heated until it is about 2192 F 1200 C then rolled back and forth between grooved rolls until it has reached the proper size,Relevant
Giant shears cut the billet to the desired length then it is allowed to cool,Relevant
It is also possible to form billets directly from molten steel by pouring it through a water cooled copper mold to shape it then spraying it with water to solidify it,Irrelevant
To make barbed wire iron ore coke and limestone are heated in a blast furnace to produce pig iron,Irrelevant
The pig iron is purified and converted to steel,Relevant
The steel billet is again heated and rolled until it has been shaped into a round bar 0 2 inch 5 6 mm in diameter known as a wire rod,Relevant
The wire rod is rolled into a coil weighing as much as 3 969 pounds 1 800 kg which is shipped to the wire manufacturer,Relevant
Scale a surface coating of iron oxide which forms on steel when it is heated must be removed from the wire rod,Irrelevant
This can be done by soaking it in hot dilute acid sulfuric acid at 180 F [82 C] or hydrochloric acid at 140 F [60 C] and rinsing it with water a process known as pickling,Irrelevant
Scale can also be removed by bending the wire rod back and forth between a series of wheels to break it off or by blasting it off with fast moving particles of sand aluminum oxide or cast iron shot,Relevant
The clean wire rod is coated with lime borax or phosphate,Relevant
This coating prevents rusting neutralizes any remaining traces of acid and helps lubricants adhere to the wire rod when it is made into wire,Irrelevant
One end of the coated wire rod is shaped to a point,Irrelevant
This end is inserted like a thread going through the eye of a needle into a die consisting of a very hard central nib made of tungsten carbide surrounded by a steel holder,Irrelevant
The wire rod is lubricated with oil or soap and is pulled through the die to reduce its diameter,Relevant
This process is known as drawing,Irrelevant
A series of dies are used to reduce the wire rod from its Barbed Wireoriginal size to the desired size of the wire,Irrelevant
For barbed wire the diameter is typically 0 097 inch 2 5 mm ,Irrelevant
Usually about six or seven dies are needed to reach this size,Irrelevant
Drawing the wire causes it to become hard and stiff,Irrelevant
To make it pliable it is heated a process known as annealing,Irrelevant
Wire can be annealed by heating it in a bath of molten salt a bath of molten lead or in a furnace containing nitrogen,Irrelevant
All these methods prevent scale from forming by protecting the steel from oxygen,Irrelevant
Wire to be made into barbed wire is usually galvanized coated with zinc to protect it from corrosion,Irrelevant
The wire must be perfectly clean and dry to be properly galvanized,Irrelevant
First it is cleaned in a bath of hot dilute hydrochloric acid then rinsed with hot water,Relevant
It then passes through a solution of hot zinc chloride or ammonium chloride to prevent rust from forming as it is dried,Relevant
After drying the wire passes through a bath of molten zinc,Relevant
Excess zinc is wiped off and the coated wire is allowed to cool,Relevant
Some times the wire is coated with aluminum instead in a similar way ,Irrelevant
Wire can also be coated with zinc by a process known as electrogalvanizing,Irrelevant
The wire is given a negative electric charge and passed through a solution of zinc sulfate or some other zinc salt,Relevant
The positive zinc ions are attracted to the negative wire and form a coating,Relevant
A single automated machine performs all the steps needed to transform galvanized wire into barbed wire,Relevant
Two wires are fed into the machine and twisted together to form the cable,Relevant
Another wire is fed into the machine from the side and twisted around one or both of the cable wires,Relevant
This wire is cut at an angle on both sides to form a two point barb,Relevant
Two wires are twisted and cut together if four point barbs are needed,Relevant
The barbed wire is pulled along a set distance usually 4 or 5 inches [10 or 13 cm] and the process is repeated to space the barbs evenly,Relevant
The barbed wire is wound onto spools and cut into 1 319 foot 402 m lengths,Relevant
These spools are then loaded onto trucks and shipped to the customer,Relevant
A mill worker places each split onto an automatic lathe that shaves the rough edges off as it turns the wood,Irrelevant
The billets as they are now called are inspected again for straightness of grain,Irrelevant
The billets are stacked and strapped together into six sided bundles,Relevant
Workers paint the ends with a protective preservative to keep the wood from fraying or rotting,Relevant
The bundled billets are then trucked to the lumberyard of the bat manufacturer,Relevant
The billets that arrive at the lumberyard are considered green wood because they still contain sap and gum,Relevant
In order to strengthen the wood the sap and gum must be removed by an air drying process called seasoning,Irrelevant
To achieve the proper seasoning the billets are simply stacked in the yard for a period of six months to two years,Relevant
The plant workers who create the final product are called bat turners,Irrelevant
When an order is placed the bat turner selects a billet from the storage bin and creates a replica of the desired model,Relevant
When the billets have dried completely they are weighed and inspected for quality,Relevant
A worker places each billet on an automatic lathe and shapes it into a rough baseball bat shape with a narrowed neck,Irrelevant
The bat forms are sanded inspected once more and then sorted according to weight,Relevant
The bat manufacturer keeps a model of each bat made typically identified by the baseball player who initially ordered it,Irrelevant
When a player or team places an order the order may look like this six Johnny Bench models ten Hank Aarons four Mickey Mantles,Irrelevant
They are highly skilled artisans who have been specially trained for the intricate work,Irrelevant
When an order is placed the bat turner selects a billet from the storage bin that fits the called for weight and length,Relevant
The billet is placed on a lathe,Relevant
The model bat is placed on a rack above and behind the lathe,Relevant
The bat turner revolves the billet slowly on the lathe sanding and shaving it to an exact replica of the model,Relevant
Using calipers the bat turner measures the billet every 1 2 inches 2 54 5 cm and weighs it repeatedly until it is perfect,Relevant
The bat is branded with the company trademark and the signature of the player associated with the model,Relevant
The trademark is placed one quarter of a turn from the sweet spot the ideal spot where the ball should strike the bat ,Relevant
If the order calls for staining the bat is dipped into a staining vat,Irrelevant
All of the bats are then varnished packed into cartons and shipped to the player or team,Relevant
The metal is either cast into molds gray cast iron or drawn into sheet and formed steel ,Relevant
Before enameling it must then be cleaned,Relevant
Cleaning of castings is carried out by blasting the surface with chilled iron grit sometimes after preliminary annealing heating at 1350 1500 F [730 820 C] ,Relevant
The grit or shot is projected through nozzles using compressed air or flung against the surface by centrifugal force using a special machine,Irrelevant
A combination of both methods may be used,Irrelevant
This blasting removes any dirt or sand particles from the mold from the metal surface,Irrelevant
Sheet metal must undergo a more complex cleaning process,Irrelevant
First the surface is cleaned by shot blasting after annealing to release stresses and to remove any grease deposits,Relevant
Degreasing is done with chemical cleaners first with an organic solvent followed by a hot alkaline solution,Relevant
The organic solvent removes most of the grease and oil from the metal surface,Relevant
The alkaline solution removes the remaining film of oil and leaves a surface ready for acid pickling,Relevant
Acid pickling uses hydrochloric or sulfuric acid or a combination of these acids,Relevant
This process de scales the surface which helps to form a strong bond between the iron and ground coat enamel,Irrelevant
Pickling is followed by rinsing in running water,Relevant
The next step is sometimes a nickel dip which uses a solution of nickel sulfate and boric acid to coat the metal with a layer of nickel,Relevant
This layer also helps to form a good bond with the enamel,Relevant
The nickel dip is followed by a thorough rinsing of the ware and another dip in a neutralizer solution,Relevant
This solution consists of soda ash and borax in water and removes any traces of acid as well as prevents rust,Irrelevant
After neutralizing the metal is dried as quickly as possible to prevent rusting,Relevant
After the raw materials are carefully weighed and mixed together in precise amounts the enamel frit is prepared by melting the batch in furnaces of rotary or continuous type fueled by oil or gas,Relevant
When melting is completed the molten enamel is run out of the furnace in a thin stream into a tank of cold water which produces small fragments,Relevant
For continuous furnaces the molten frit is run between water cooled rolls which chills the frit,Relevant
The frit is then dried and stored in bags,Relevant
Before the enamel is applied it must be ground into a powder using a ball mill with blocks of enamel as the grinding media,Relevant
If applied wet the enamel is milled with additions of clay and water to make a slip or slurry,Irrelevant
Dry enamel is dusted on the metal surface which has been previously heated to a temperature above the melting point of the enamel,Relevant
The powder melts on contact with the hot article forming a continuous coating,Relevant
Firing in a furnace produces a smooth porcelain like surface,Relevant
Wet enamel is applied by a dipping process using a large open tank,Relevant
After dipping the coated part is allowed to drain producing a thin uniform coating,Relevant
The dipping tank uses a recalculating system to recycle the enamel,Irrelevant
The wet enamel may also be applied using automatic spraying equipment,Relevant
After enameling the coated parts are dried using cabinet or conveyor dryers heated by gas burners steam or waste heat from the enameling furnaces or infrared lamps,Relevant
Firing takes place in furnaces heated by metallic heating elements,Irrelevant
Two coatings of enamel are normally applied a ground coat followed by a cover coat,Relevant
The cover coat takes longer to fire,Relevant
A number of processes are used to form plastics into shapes including calendaring squeezing between rollers to form films casting compression molding and injection molding melting and forcing into a cooled mold ,Irrelevant
In injection molding a reciprocating screw machine is generally used which melts the plastic pressurizes the melt to inject it into a closed mold closes the mold so the plastic can solidify and opens the mold to allow removal of the part,Relevant
Injection occurs as the screw is hydraulically forced forward in the barrel,Relevant
During the cooling and solidification period the screw begins to rotate and melt new material for the next part,Relevant
Compression molding is used to make both plastic and fiber reinforced bathtubs,Relevant
For reinforced bathtubs a mixture of fibers polyester resin and pigments fillers and other additives are mixed together and formed into a sheet,Relevant
In this process a specified amount of resin filler paste is placed onto a plastic carrier film using a special machine,Relevant
The carrier film is passed under a chopper which cuts glass roving into short lengths,Relevant
After the glass falls to the resin bed another carrier film with another layer of paste is added on top sandwiching the glass between the two layers,Relevant
This sandwich structure is passed through a series of compaction rollers to thoroughly mix the fibers and resin,Relevant
After the materialcalled a sheet molding compoundthickens the carrier film is removed and the sheet material is cut into charges which are placed in matched metal die molds made of machined steel,Relevant
High pressure is applied which heats the material so that it flows to all areas of the mold,Relevant
Heat from the mold activates the catalyst which achieves curing,Relevant
Once cured the part is then removed from the mold,Relevant
Two processes called hand lay up and spray lay up are used to make fiberglass bathtubs,Irrelevant
Hand lay up is a method in which successive plies of reinforcing material or resin impregnated reinforcement are positioned in a mold by hand,Irrelevant
Cure occurs at room temperature with no applied pressure,Irrelevant
Special tools are used to work out air bubbles and ensure complete wetting of the fiber if the polymer is added separately,Irrelevant
The spray lay up process is faster than hand lay up and involves feeding a stream of chopped fibers into a spray of liquid plastic in a mold cavity,Irrelevant
The direction of the fibers is random and the process is usually automated,Irrelevant
After lay up is completed the plastic must solidify or cure in a reasonable time at room temperature which occurs via chemical reactions,Relevant
A group or array of one or more receiver or decoder printed circuit boards is run through a machine called a solder printer,Relevant
Printed circuit boards PCB are thin stiff pieces of electrically non conducting material onto which a pattern of electrically conducting material has been bonded to form numerous circuit paths much like flat wires,Irrelevant
Electronic components are attached to both sides of the board and interconnected by the printed circuitry,Relevant
The solder printer is programmed to apply a small amount of solder paste to the points where the components will make electrical contact with the printed circuits,Relevant
The PCBs are then processed through another machine known as a high speed chip shooter,Relevant
The shooter quickly and accurately places or shoots the majority of the pager s small components onto each board,Relevant
After a visual inspection the PCBs are run through a series of robotic placement machines which place the larger and odd shaped parts onto the boards,Relevant
These include the integrated circuit IC chips oscillators and crystal filters,Irrelevant
Once all these parts have been placed the boards are run through a reflow oven,Relevant
In this oven the solder paste melts or reflows to form an electrical connection between the components and the printed circuits,Relevant
The board arrays are then given a final visual inspection for defects and are sent through the singulation process in which the individual boards are cut from the array and labeled,Relevant
Some pagers require parts which must be placed by hand in a process called post reflow assembly,Irrelevant
These parts are generally too large for robotic placement or too sensitive to the extreme heat of the reflow oven,Irrelevant
The liquid crystal display LCD is attached to the decoder board and the decoder board with the LCD is placed Beeperinto the plastic outer housing,Relevant
The housing also contains the on off switch belt fastener clip and battery compartment with electrical contacts,Irrelevant
At this point the pagers have none of their specific features,Irrelevant
They have not been assigned a radio frequency nor have they been programmed with a unique telephone number or any customer options,Irrelevant
All of that will happen in the back end process,Irrelevant
First a crystal is soldered to the receiver board,Relevant
A crystal is an electronic component which can be activated only by a specific radio frequency,Irrelevant
The crystal is selected to match the radio frequency assigned to the pager,Irrelevant
The receiver board is then connected to the decoder board inside the pager housing and the housing is sent through a laser which is programmed to etch the pager identification number and other data onto the back cover of the housing,Relevant
The pager is sent to the programming station where it is automatically programmed with a unique identification number and a large spectrum of options selected by the customer,Relevant
The After programming the pager crystal and filter frequencies are tuned at a manual tuning station,Relevant
This ensures the pager will receive the exact radio frequency assigned to it and prevents reception of messages intended for other pagers on other frequencies,Relevant
Sometimes this process is done automatically,Irrelevant
In the final assembly station the back I cover is secured onto the decoder board a battery is inserted and the pager is turned on,Relevant
After passing a radio frequency test and a final visual inspection the pager is packed and sent to the customer,Relevant
Fully ripened barley grains are steeped or soaked in cold water until they are fully saturated,Relevant
The water is changed once a day and after 45 72 hours the grains are placed in shallow tanks,Relevant
The grain is aerated and stirred which causes it to germinate releasing enzymes such as malt diastase,Relevant
Malt diastase converts the starches contained in the grain to sugar for fermentation,Relevant
As soon as the germination is adequately complete usually six days the grain is roasted to stop the germination process,Relevant
The exact point at which the roasting starts and ends affects the flavor and color of the beer,Relevant
The product at this point is referred to as malt,Relevant

The automatic canning machinery dwarfs the workers in this 1970s brewery canning room,Irrelevant
The malt is crushed using iron rollers and transferred to the mash tank or tun ,Irrelevant
This tank is a large copper or stainless steel vessel that mixes the malt with warm water until it is of porridge like consistency,Irrelevant
This mixture is called mash,Irrelevant
After mixing with similarly prepared cereal grains the temperature of the mash is raised incrementally from 100 170 F 38 77 C so that the enzymes react,Relevant
The enzymes break down the starch in the grain and convert it to simple sugars,Relevant
Later the yeast will convert the sugars into alcohol,Relevant
Once complete the mash is allowed to sit undisturbed so the solids can descend to the bottom of the tank,Relevant
Beer requires these ingredients for proper brewing prepared cereal grain usually barley and corn or rice hops pure water and brewer s yeast,Irrelevant
Each ingredient can affect flavor color carbonation alcohol content and other subtle changes in the beer,Irrelevant
The liquid contained in the mash is transferred into another tank called a lauter tun,Relevant
This is accomplished by drawing the liquid out through the bottom layer of mash solids which acts as a filter,Relevant
Hot water is added to the top of the mash tank to rinse the remaining liquid now called wort from the mash,Relevant
The solid remains of the grain are dried and sold by the brewery as animal feed,Relevant
The wort travels on to the brew kettles where it is boiled to sterilize it and where the carefully prepared hops are added,Relevant
The addition of the hops is important because they contribute to the bitterness of the beer,Irrelevant
The brew kettles are the most impressive equipment in the process,Irrelevant
Gleaming copper they can be 7 12 feet 2 3 6 m in diameter and two stories high,Irrelevant
Steam usually provides the heating energy to the brew kettles,Irrelevant
After brewing is complete the finished wort is filtered again and pumped to the fermentation tanks,Relevant
In the fermentation tanks the atmosphere must be carefully controlled to prevent any rouge bacteria from interfering with the yeast,Irrelevant
Carefully maintained yeast approximately one pound per barrel of wort is added to the wort and the temperature of the mixture is slowly reduced over a period of days to between 50 F and 60 F 10 15 C ,Irrelevant
In this temperature range the yeast grows consuming the sugar in the wort and bubbles of carbon dioxide form,Irrelevant
The wort has now become beer,Irrelevant
The new beer is filtered and transferred once more into the aging casks where the temperature is controlled at 33 F C for 2 24 weeks,Relevant
The shorter storage time produces a pale lager beer while the European lagers called BeerPilsner are aged longer to increase the alcohol content,Irrelevant
After aging the beer can be pasteurized to kill the remaining yeast and prevent further alcohol production,Relevant
This is accomplished by heating the beer above 135 F 57 C ,Relevant
This process named after Louis Pasteur is widely known for preserving milk,Irrelevant
Interestingly Pasteur originally developed this process to preserve beer in the 1860s,Irrelevant
Pasteurization however is not used in the production of genuine draft beers,Irrelevant
These beers are also known as ice beers since they must be kept refrigerated to preserve their flavor and slow the remaining yeast activity,Irrelevant
Many consider the draft beers best in aroma as well as taste,Irrelevant
Whether packaged into cans bottles or kegs the beer is always moved gently through the maze of piping in the bottling area,Irrelevant
This is to preserve the natural carbonation,Irrelevant
During bottling additional carbon dioxide gas from the fermentation kettles is used to improve the aroma of the beer,Relevant
High speed packaging lines can process thousands of cases of beer per day and with modern computerized control the inventory can be tracked throughout the distribution network,Irrelevant
Most beer is delivered from local distributors who have purchasing contracts with the major breweries,Irrelevant
Most beer is available in the following package sizes pony cans and bottles of about 8 fluid ounces standard 12 ounce cans and bottles 16 and 32 ounce jumbo cans 40 ounce picnic bottles 8 gallon pony kegs and the standard 16 gallon beer keg,Irrelevant
Other novelty and party packages are also available,Irrelevant
Cans and bottles are packed in 6 8 12 or 24 each to a box or case,Relevant
Most states require a deposit at point of sale to encourage the return of the bottles and cans,Relevant
When beer is dispensed from the keg a pressure apparatus called a tapper is used to apply a light pressure of carbon dioxide usually 2 6 PSI to the tapper head for dispensing,Relevant
The craft of casting bells has remained essentially the same since the 12th century,Irrelevant
BellThe one singular innovation was the invention of the tuning machine in the 19th century,Irrelevant
Prior to that time the proper tone was achieved by chipping the sides of the bell with a hammer and chisel,Irrelevant
This procedure carried a high risk of damaging the bell,Irrelevant
The tuning machine which is essentially a vertical lathe has reduced that risk,Irrelevant
Electronic tuning machines have increased the bell founder s ability to test the accuracy of the bell s tone,Irrelevant
All in all however creating a bell is still very much a hands on process,Irrelevant
Using the specifications submitted by the purchaser the bellmaker determines the shape that the bell will need to take in order to resonate with the proper number of vibrations,Irrelevant
After estimating the required weight the bellmaker orders the metal,Relevant
These are painstaking measurements that can take several weeks of calculations to accomplish,Irrelevant
The bellmaker cuts out two wooden templates called strickle boards,Relevant
One of the boards matches the dimensions of the outer bell called the case or cope the other matches that of the inner bell called the core ,Relevant
These templates are used to construct the mold,Relevant
An exact stone model of the outer bell sometimes called a false bell is covered first with sand or loam then with molten wax,Irrelevant
Figures and inscriptions also made of wax are applied by hand,Relevant
The false bell is Bellpainted over with three coats of very fine fireproof clay,Irrelevant
It is then enclosed in a steel mantle that has been lowered by rope pulleys,Relevant
The space between the false bell and the mantle is filled with cement,Relevant
After the cement has hardened the mantle is lifted off the cement mold,Relevant
The false bell under the mold is chipped away,Relevant
Any remaining scraps of the false bell are removed with a blow torch,Relevant
The mold is then set over a coke fire to melt the remaining wax and to evaporate any water that has accumulated,Relevant
A model of the inner bell is constructed of stone and coated with fireproof cement,Relevant
It is then smoothed to remove any irregularities,Relevant
After the mantle has been cleaned it is again lowered over the outer bell model,Relevant
The mantle and the outer bell mold are then lowered over the inner mold,Relevant
The outer and inner sections are clamped together leaving a space between them and set into a pit,Relevant
Ingots of bronze are melted in oil burners and heated to a temperature of approximately 1150 F 1100 C ,Relevant
The molten metal is skimmed to remove impurities and then poured into drums,Relevant
The drums are carried to the pit and carefully tipped so that the hot metal flows into the space between the two molds,Relevant
Holes in the top of the mantle allow gases to escape,Irrelevant
If the gases remained in the metal the bell would be too porous and easily cracked,Irrelevant
The bell is allowed to cool for several days,Relevant
Large bells can take as much as a week to cool completely,Irrelevant
Small bells usually classified as those under 500 pounds 227 kg can be removed from the molding pit the next day,Irrelevant
The bell is cast with slightly thicker sides so that the bell can be ground as it twirls slowly upside down on a circular lathe to acquire the precise tone,Relevant
The bell tuner is highly skilled it takes years of experience to know just how much metal to remove,Relevant
The bell tone is tested frequently during the tuning process using an electronic device that registers the vibrations as the bell is struck,Relevant
If the tone is too low the lathe operator grinds more metal off the lower edge of the bell,Relevant
If the tone is too high the bell is thinned with a file,Relevant
The clapper is manufactured in much the same manner as the bell itself,Relevant
Special care is given to cast the clapper at the proper weight,Relevant
A clapper that is too light weight will not bring out the true tones of the bell,Irrelevant
A heavy clapper might cause the bell to crack,Irrelevant
Holes are drilled into the top of the bell,Relevant
Using mounting bolts and supports the clapper is fastened to the bell,Relevant
Seamless frame tubes are constructed from solid blocks of steel that are pierced and drawn into tubes through several stages,Relevant
These are usually superior to seamed tubes which are made by drawing flat steel strip stock wrapping it into a tube and welding it together along the length of the tube,Irrelevant
Seamless tubes may then be further manipulated to increase their strength and decrease their weight by butting or altering the thickness of the tube walls,Irrelevant
Butting involves increasing the thickness of the walls at the joints or ends of the tube where the most stress is delivered and thinning the walls at the center of the tube where there is relatively little stress,Relevant
Butted tubing also improves the resiliency of the frame,Irrelevant
Butted tubes may be single butted with one end thicker double butted with both ends thicker than the center triple butted with different thicknesses at either end and quad butted similar to a triple but with the center thinning towards the middle,Irrelevant
Constant thickness tubes however are also appropriate for certain bikes,Irrelevant
The tubes are assembled into a frame by hand brazing or welding by machine the former being a more labor intensive process and therefore more expensive,Relevant
Composites may be joined with strong glue or plastic binders,Irrelevant
The components are generally manufactured by machine and may be attached to the frame by hand or machine,Irrelevant
Final adjustments are made by skilled bicycle builders,Irrelevant
The metal is annealed or softened by heating and hollowed out to form hollows or blooms,Relevant
These are heated again pickled in acid to remove scale and lubricated,Relevant
The hollows are measured cut and precision mitered to the appropriate dimensions,Relevant
Frame sizes for adult bicycles generally run from 19 25 inches 48 63 cm from the top of the seat post tube to the middle of the crank hanger,Irrelevant
Next the hollows are fitted over a mandrel or rod attached to a draw bench,Relevant
To achieve the right gauge the hollows pass through dies which stretch them into thinner and longer tubes a process called cold drawing,Relevant
The tubes may be shaped and tapered into a variety of designs and lengths,Irrelevant
The taper gauge fork blades may have to pass through more than a dozen operations to achieve the correct strength weight and resilience,Irrelevant
Tubes can be joined into a frame either by hand or machine,Irrelevant
Frames may be brazed welded or glued with or without lugs which are the metal sleeves joining two or more tubes at a joint,Relevant
Brazing is essentially welding at a temperature of about 1600 F 871 C or lower,Relevant
Gas burners are arranged evenly around the lugs which are heated forming a white flux that melts and cleans the surface preparing it for brazing,Irrelevant
The brazing filler is generally brass copper zinc alloy or silver which melt at lower temperatures than the tubes being joined,Relevant
The filler is applied and as it melts it flows around the joint sealing it,Relevant
The assembled frames are placed into jigs and checked for proper alignment,Relevant
Adjustments are made while the frame is still hot and malleable,Relevant
The excess flux and brazing metals are cleaned off by pickling in acid solutions and by washing and grinding the brazing until it is smooth,Relevant
After the metals have cooled further precision alignments are made,Relevant
The frames are painted not only to create a more finished appearance but also to protect the frame,Relevant
The frame is first primed with an undercoat and then painted with a colored enamel,Relevant
Paint may be applied by hand spraying or by passing the frames through automatic electrostatic spraying rooms,Irrelevant
The negatively charged frames attract the positively charged paint spray as the frames rotate for full coverage,Irrelevant
Finally transfers and lacquer are applied to the frame,Relevant
Chrome plating may also be used instead of paint on components such as the fork blades,Relevant
The manufacture of sodium hypochlorite bleach requires several steps,Irrelevant
All the steps can be carried out at one large manufacturing facility or the chlorine and caustic soda can be shipped from different plants to the reactor site,Irrelevant
Both chlorine and caustic soda are hazardous chemicals and are transported according to strict regulations,Relevant
Caustic soda is usually produced and shipped as a concentrated 50% solution,Irrelevant
At its destination this concentrated solution is diluted with water to form a new 25% solution,Relevant
Heat is created when the water dilutes the strong caustic soda solution,Relevant
The diluted caustic soda is cooled before it is reacted,Relevant
Chlorine and the caustic soda solution are reacted to form sodium hypochlorite bleach,Relevant
This reaction can take place in a batch of about 14 000 gallons or in a continuous reactor,Irrelevant
To create sodium hypochlorite liquid or gaseous chlorine is circulated through the caustic soda solution,Irrelevant
The reaction of chlorine and caustic soda is essentially instantaneous,Irrelevant
The bleach solution is then cooled to help prevent decomposition,Relevant
Often this cooled bleach is settled or filtered to remove impurities that can discolor the bleach or catalyze its decomposition,Relevant
The finished sodium hypochlorite bleach is shipped to a bottling plant or bottled on site,Relevant
Household strength bleach is typically 5 25% sodium hypochlorite in an aqueous solution,Relevant
The sifted flour is poured into an industrial mixer,Relevant
Temperature controlled water Breadis piped into the mixer,Irrelevant
This mixture is called gluten and gives bread its elasticity,Irrelevant
A pre measured amount of yeast is added,Relevant
Yeast is actually a tiny organism which feeds off the sugars in the grain and emits carbon dioxide,Irrelevant
The growth of the yeast produces gas bubbles which leaven the bread,Relevant
Depending on the type of bread to be made other ingredients are also poured into the mixer,Relevant
Modern mixers can process up to 2 000 pounds 908 kg of dough per minute,Irrelevant
The mixer is essentially an enclosed drum that rotates at speeds between 35 to 75 revolutions per minute,Irrelevant
Inside the drum mechanical arms knead the dough to the desired consistency in a matter of seconds,Irrelevant
Although modern bread production is highly computerized the ability of the mixing staff to judge the elasticity and appearance of the dough is critical,Irrelevant
Experienced personnel will be able to determine the consistency by the sound of the dough as it rolls around the mixer,Irrelevant
The mixing process takes about 12 minutes,Irrelevant
Three methods are used to ferment the dough,Irrelevant
In some plants the high speed machinery is designed to manipulate the dough at extreme speeds and with great force which forces the yeast cells to rapidly multiply,Irrelevant
Fermentation can also be induced by the addition of chemical additives such as 1 cysteine a naturally occurring amino acid and vitamin C,Irrelevant
Some breads are allowed to ferment naturally,Irrelevant
In this instance the dough is placed in covered metal bowls and stored in a temperature controlled room until it rises,Relevant
After the dough has fermented it is loaded into a divider with rotating blades that cut the dough into pre determined weights,Relevant
A conveyer belt then moves the pieces of dough to a molding machine,Relevant
The molding machine shapes the dough into balls and drops them onto a layered conveyer belt that is enclosed in a warm humid cabinet called a prover,Relevant
The dough moves slowly through the prover so that it may rest and so that the gas reproduction may progress,Irrelevant
When the dough emerges from the prover it is conveyed to a second molding machine which re shapes the dough into loaves and drops them into pans,Relevant
The pans travel to another prover that is set at a high temperature and with a high level of humidity,Relevant
Here the dough regains the elasticity lost during fermentation and the resting period,Relevant
From the prover the pans enter a tunnel oven,Relevant
The temperature and speed are carefully calculated so that when the loaves emerge from the tunnel they are completely baked and partially cooled,Relevant
While inside the tunnel the loaves are mechanically dumped from the pans onto shelves,Relevant
The baking and cooling process lasts approximately 30 minutes,Irrelevant
The bread continues to cool as it moves from the oven to the slicing machine,Relevant
Here vertical serrated blades move up and down at great speeds slicing the bread into consistently sized pieces,Relevant
Metal plates hold the slices together while picking up each loaf and passing it to the wrapping machine,Relevant
Pre printed plastic bags are mechanically slipped over each loaf,Relevant
At some bakeries workers close the bags with wire twists,Relevant
Other plants seal the bags with heat,Relevant
Some bungee jumping companies design and manufacture their own cord,Relevant
In general this is a proprietary process which they keep secret,Irrelevant
The following describes a typical Bungee Cordprocess by which commercial or milspec bungee cords are manufactured,Irrelevant
Natural or synthetic rubber is prepared and extruded into long ribbons of rubber,Relevant
These ribbons are approximately 0 09 inch to 0 12 inch 0 24 0 32 cm thick 0 25 inch 0 64 cm wide and up to 100 feet 30 m long,Irrelevant
The extruder consists of a heated cylinder into which the rubber is placed,Relevant
One end of the cylinder moves under pressure to force the rubber out through a small hole in the other end,Relevant
The hole or die is in the shape of the desired ribbon cross section,Relevant
When the rubber ribbons have cooled they are coiled and shipped to the bungee cord manufacturer,Relevant
The number of ribbons or strands in a bungee cord determines the diameter of the cord and the overall tensile strength rating,Irrelevant
The appropriate number of rubber strands are partially unwound from their coils,Irrelevant
To prevent the individual strands from sticking to each other in hot weather they are coated with finely powdered talc or soapstone,Relevant
This is done continuously as the strands are being unwound from the coils during the braiding process steps 3 and 4 below ,Relevant
The free ends of the rubber strands are brought together and manually fed through a machine called the braider,Relevant
At the input end of the braider they pass through a roller or other device which gently squeezes them into a bundle,Relevant
At the other end another roller or a take up reel pulls the strands through the machine,Relevant
By adjusting the pressures and speeds of the input and output devices the rubber strands are placed under tension and slightly stretched while they pass through the machine,Relevant
This reduces the diameter of the bundle of rubber strands to allow the fabric covering to be wound tightly,Irrelevant
The braider weaves the covering yarn around the stretched rubber bundle as it passes through the machine,Relevant
The yarn must be woven in a tight enough pattern to prevent dirt from entering gaps between the yarn threads when the cord is fully extended,Relevant
If two or more layers of covering are required they are woven one after the other,Irrelevant
The outer covering yarn may be colored and woven in a pattern for age dating or decorative purposes,Relevant
See Quality Control ,Irrelevant
The finished bungee cord is cut to length coiled and placed in cardboard boxes for shipping,Relevant
Some cords are first placed in dark plastic bags as further protection against ultraviolet radiation during handling and storage,Relevant
The end fittings may be attached by someone other than the bungee cord manufacturer,Relevant
In the case of commercial bungee cord used as luggage and equipment tie downs another manufacturer or distributor cuts the bungee cord into the required lengths doubles each end over and tightly coils a stiff wire around the ends with a wire coiler machine,Relevant
The other end of this wire is usually bent into a j shaped hook to allow the ends to be secured,Irrelevant
Bungee cord used for bungee jumping may have the ends bent around a non metallic eye and wrapped with a strong waxed string called whipping that is wound tightly while the cord is stretched,Relevant
Other end fittings may involve sewing the cord to fabric webbing,Irrelevant
The fuselage group is the first main assembly to be produced,Irrelevant
The fuselage group consists of the nose structure assembly forward cabin structure assembly aft cabin structure assembly and the tailcone assembly,Irrelevant
The aircraft is essentially assembled from the back forward,Irrelevant
The first part of the fuselage to be assembled is the aft cabin barrel assembly see illustration marked Position 4 Setback 0 ,Relevant
The cabin barrel is assembled in the vertical direction in a floor assembly jig,Relevant
The cabin barrel jig incorporates all the frame assemblies skins and supporting structures necessary to complete the aft cabin barrel assembly,Irrelevant
Details and sub assemblies are provided with tooling holes and locators set to contour templates which define the aircraft s loft or contour,Relevant
Next an aft cabin intermediate jig is used to assemble three primary components the aft cabin barrel the aft pressure bulkhead which serves as the boundary of the pressurized section of the fuselage and the wing attach fittings,Relevant
The nose and forward cabin structures are assembled next see Position 3 Setback 1 ,Irrelevant
The nose section jig assembles the forward frame wheelwell assembly skin assemblies and supporting structures,Relevant
The forward cabin buildup jig assembles the windshield frame cabin door frame forward pressure bulkhead supporting structure and skins,Relevant

The tail cone mate jig is used to connect and align the upper and lower tailcone subassemblies see Position 2 Setback 2 and Position 2 Setback 1 ,Relevant
The three primary fuselage sections nose forward and aft cabin assemnbly and tailcone are located and assembled using a fuselage mate jig,Relevant
The forward and aft cabin sections are loaded into the jig first followed by the nose and tailcone sections,Relevant
Engine mount brackets forward and aft are now installed onto the structural engine beams which extend out from the fuselage,Relevant
Mounting holes are also aligned,Relevant
These will be used to attach the vertical stabilizer to the tailcone and the aft canted bulkhead the aft canted bulkhead caps off the end of the tailcone section ,Irrelevant
See Position 2 Setback 0 ,Irrelevant
The empennage or tail assembly is the next section to be assembled,Irrelevant
It consists of the vertical fin rudder horizontal stabilizer and elevators,Relevant
The rudder is the primary control surface for yaw or side to side movement usually used to turn the aircraft,Relevant
Two elevators are mounted on the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer and are used to control the pitch or up and down motion of the air craft,Relevant
The horizontal stabilizer frame buildup jig is used to assemble the leading edge and spar assemblies along with the vertical attach fittings stringers aluminum extrusions which are used to provide structural support for sheet metal skins skins and supporting structures see Position 1 Setback 2 ,Relevant
Elevator frame buildup trim tab assembly and skinning jigs are used to assemble the right and left hand elevators,Relevant
The trim tabs are movable control surfaces attached on the trailing edge of the elevators used to hold the aircraft in level flight during cruise conditions somewhat analogous to cruise control in a car ,Relevant
After the elevator frame and trim tabs are constructed the skinning jig is then used to assemble the frame and trim tab assemblies along with the tip leading and trailing edge skins,Relevant
The vertical fin buildup jig is used to assemble the leading edge spar and bonded skin assemblies along with the horizontal attach side plates and the supporting structure required to complete the vertical fin section,Relevant
The fastener locations in the tailcone are established by the airframe alignment jig to ensure the vertical fin s relationship to the wing and engine attach points,Relevant
Rudder frame buildup trim tab assembly and skinning jigs are utilized in assembling the rudder assembly,Relevant
After the rudder frame and trim tab is completed the skinning jig is then used to assemble the frame and trim tab assemblies along with the leading and trailing edge skins,Relevant
The empennage section of the aircraft is completed after the elevators horizontal stabilizer vertical stabilizer and rudder are assembled the rudder is usually installed last along with the flight control systems ,Relevant
See Position 1 Setback 1 ,Irrelevant
The empennage section is then mated to the aircraft tailcone section see Position 1 Setback 0 ,Relevant
The wing assembly is next and typically consists of the center wing section outboard wing sections and aileron and flap assemblies,Relevant
The ailerons are movable control surfaces usually hinged to the outer wing which help provide control in roll about the longitudinal axis of the plane,Relevant
The flaps are movable control surfaces mounted inboard on the wing which are able to hinge down ward,Relevant
These increase low speed lift and add drag allowing the aircraft to make steep approach landings without gaining excess airspeed,Relevant
Aileron frame buildup and skin and rivet jigs are used to assemble the left and right hand aileron assemblies,Relevant
After the aileron frame is completed the skin and rivet jig is used to load the aileron frame skin and doublers used for extra strength then rivet the assembly complete,Relevant
The aileron frame is located by pinning the hinge bearings and the inboard and out board rib webs the ribs are primary structural members running across the aileron ,Relevant
The ailerons are usually installed last along with the flight control instruments and flaps,Relevant
Flap frame buildup and skin jigs are used in constructing the left and right hand flap assemblies,Relevant
The flap frame is completed first,Relevant
Then the flap skin jig assembles the bonded upper skin and trailing edge skin flap spar section leading edge assembly and end ribs and interconnect clevises,Relevant
The building of the outboard wing section involves the use of many different jigs for drilling riveting and buildup,Relevant
The main tool used is the outboard wing buildup jig which assembles the forward outboard wing assembly rear spar assembly trailing edge bonded skin assemblies and the supporting structure see Position 1 Setback 3 ,Relevant
The construction of the center wing section also requires the use of many different buildup jigs,Irrelevant
The primary tool used here is the center wing buildup jig which assembles the center section subassembly wheelwell structure rib and skin assemblies and the supporting structure see Position 1 Setback 2 ,Relevant
The wing assembly mate jig assembles both the left and right outboard wings with the center wing,Relevant
The wing sections and center section are located in the jig by locators and contour boards,Relevant
The center section is loaded first followed by the left and right outboard wings see Position 1 Setback 1 ,Relevant
The completed wing assembly is then mated to the fuselage section see Position 1 Setback 0 ,Relevant
There are two different landing gear assemblies the nose and main landing gears,Relevant
Both use retraction systems which are electrically controlled and hydraulically actuated,Irrelevant
The main landing gear MLG is usually a trailing link type and retracts inboard into the wing,Irrelevant
The nose landing gear NLG retracts forward into the fuselage nose section and is enclosed by doors,Irrelevant
The landing gears are assembled away from the main assembly line and are brought to the line when needed usually when the fuselage and wings are being mated see Position 1 Setback 0 ,Relevant
A business jet is typically powered by two turbofan jet engines located on each side of the rear fuselage in nacelle assemblies,Relevant
The nacelle assemblies consist of an inlet section a cowl or outer housing an exhaust nozzle section and a bleed air system which diverts hot air to the wing and nacelle leading edges for deicing,Relevant
Bleed air is also used for cabin heating and pressurization,Irrelevant
The large sheet metal panels which form the cowl are typically roll formed,Irrelevant
Some of the other sheet metal parts such as the nose cap on the nacelle inlet section are formed using a female die in a draw press,Irrelevant
Nacelle assemblies are built separately away from the line and then brought back for installation see Position 1 Setback 0 ,Relevant
The flight control systems are usually installed last along with the ailerons flaps and rudder,Relevant
There are many different flight control systems which go into a modern air craft,Relevant

See Position 1 Setback 0 ,Irrelevant
Before the aircraft leaves the factory all electrical and mechanical systems undergo a functional test,Relevant
Examples of items checked are fuel calibration hydraulic systems gear blow down and lock warning lights and horns and avionics,Irrelevant
After the engines and flight control systems are installed the aircraft is ready to go out the door for engine testing and flight test,Relevant
The aircraft is put through numerous performance and systems tests before it is approved for delivery to the customer,Relevant
Before delivery the aircraft is sent to be painted after which the interior is finished,Relevant
See Position 0 Setback 0 ,Irrelevant
For many years the major creameries for butter manufacturing were located in the states of the Eastern seaboard but the flourishing of a more industrialized agriculture in the Midwest led to the predominance of butter making facilities there,Irrelevant
The modern butter making process begins when fresh cow s milk from dairy farms is brought into the facility,Irrelevant
The product is inspected classified into different groups according to its adjudged quality and then filtered to remove impurities,Relevant
Then the milk is separated by means of centrifugal force,Relevant
It is pumped into a large cylindrical vertical rotator device,Relevant
When turned on this rotator spins the liquid until the cream rises to the top,Relevant
The cream is then fed into large stainless steel vats and heated to 180 F 82 C for about 30 minutes in the pasteurization process to remove any lingering bacteria,Relevant
The pasteurized cream is then left to cool,Relevant
The cream is placed in a large mechanical churn usually made of aluminum,Relevant
Some of these industrial sized churns can make 1 500 5 000 pounds 681 2270 kg of butter at a time,Irrelevant
When the churn is activated it tumbles the cream much like the motion of a clothes dryer while a worker watches the process through a small glass window on the churn,Relevant
After about 45 minutes small granules of butter begin to form and the butter and buttermilk are separated,Relevant
Salt is added and the mixture is churned further,Relevant
When this process is completed a stainless steel mobile device sometimes called a boat is placed adjacent to the opening of the mechanical churn,Relevant
The door of the churn is opened and the butter begins to spill out into the boat activating the churn removes the rest,Relevant
It is then wrapped into 64 pound 29 kg cartons and sent to the distributor,Relevant
There the butter is repackaged for consumer and food service industry use,Relevant
When the ingredients arrive at the margarine manufacturing facility they must first undergo a series of preparatory measures,Irrelevant
The oilsafflower corn or soybean among other typesis treated with a caustic soda solution to remove unnecessary components known as free fatty acids,Relevant
The oil is then washed by mixing it with hot water separating it and leaving it to dry under a vacuum,Relevant
Next the oil is sometimes bleached with a mixture of bleaching earth and charcoal in another vacuum chamber,Relevant
The bleaching earth and charcoal absorb any unwanted colorants and are then filtered out from the oil,Relevant
Whatever liquid is used in the manufacturing processmilk water or a soy based substanceit too must undergo preparatory measures,Relevant
It also undergoes pasteurization to remove impurities and if dry milk powder is used it must be checked for bacteria and other contaminants,Relevant
The oil is then hydrogenated to ensure the correct consistency for margarine production a state referred to as plastic or semi solid,Relevant
In this process hydrogen gas is added to the oil under pressurized conditions,Relevant
The hydrogen particles stay with the oil helping to increase the temperature point at which it will melt and to make the oil less susceptible to contamination through oxidation,Relevant
The continuous flow process is the most commonly used method in the manufacture of margarine,Relevant
If milk is used as the liquid base it is joined with salt and an emulsifying agent in a chamber,Irrelevant
The emulsifying agent ensures that the emulsification processchemically defined as a suspension of small globules of one liquid in a second liquidtakes place,Relevant
An emulsifier works by decreasing the surface tension between the oil globules and the liquid mixture thereby helping them form chemical bonds more easily,Relevant
The result is a substance that is neither wholly liquid nor wholly solid but rather a combination of the two called semi solid,Relevant
Lecithin a natural fat derived from egg yolk soybean or corn is one typical emulsification agent used in margarine manufacturing,Relevant
In the initial step the liquid salt and lecithin are mixed together into one tank opposite another vat holding the oils and oil soluble ingredients,Relevant
In the continuous flow process the contents of the two vats are fed on a timed basis into a third tank typically called the emulsification chamber,Relevant
While the blending process is taking place the equipment s sensors and regulating devices keep the mixture s temperature near 100 F 38 C ,Relevant
Next the margarine mixture is sent to a device called a Votator the brand name for the most commonly used apparatus in U S margarine manufacturing,Relevant
It has been standard equipment to the industry since the 1930s,Irrelevant
In the Votator the margarine emulsion is cooled in what is referred to as Chamber A,Irrelevant
Chamber A is divided into a trio of tubes that successively decrease its temperature,Relevant
Within two minutes the mixture has reached 45 50 F 7 10 C ,Relevant
It is then pumped into a second vat called Chamber B,Relevant
There it is occasionally agitated but generally left to sit still and form its semi solid state,Relevant
If it needs to be whipped or otherwise prepared for special consistency the agitation is done in Chamber B,Relevant
Polyester arrives at a button factory in liquid form,Relevant
At the start of the manufacturing process polyester is drained from its Buttonstorage tank and measured into a stainless steel kettle,Relevant
Then dye is added if the buttons are to be any color other than the natural translucence of the polyester,Relevant
After the dye is mixed in the liquid polyester is poured into a 3 gallon 11 l metal beaker,Relevant
The catalyst and liquid wax are added,Relevant
The mixture of polyester catalyst and wax is then poured into a large rotating metal cylinder,Relevant
The cylinders are made of steel and lined with chrome and are typically 2 feet 61 cm long and 4 feet 122 cm in diameter,Irrelevant
The cylinders lie on their sides on rollers which rotate the drums at 250 rpm,Irrelevant
The polyester solution is slowly poured into the rotating interior of the cylinder and the centrifugal force of the rotation causes the solution to spread lining the drum with an even sheet,Relevant
A greater amount of polyester is used for thicker buttons and less for thinner ones,Relevant
A 2 inch 5 cm lip around the ends of the cylinder prevents the polyester from leaking out,Relevant
As the polyester rotates in the cylinder it begins to interact with the chemical catalyst and harden,Relevant
The wax rises to the top of the sheet and also sinks to the bottom so that the hardening polyester is eventually held between two layers of wax,Relevant
This process is completed after 20 minutes of rotation,Irrelevant
The resulting polyester sheet has changed from its liquid state to a crumbly solid likened to the consistency of stale cheese,Relevant
When the sheet has reached the proper hardness the drum is stopped and the sheet is cut,Relevant
Then it is rolled out of the cylinder onto a wooden tube,Relevant
The wax makes it easy to remove from the drum but the material is still very delicate,Relevant
The top layer of wax is then peeled off and the sheet is transferred to a blanking machine,Relevant
The blanking machine moves the polyester sheet along on a conveyor belt,Relevant
As the sheet passes along the belt circular steel cutting dies descend and punch out button sized circles called blanks,Relevant
Buttons come in standard sizes and different diameter dies can be loaded into the blanking machine depending on the size needed,Irrelevant
After the blanks are cut they fall into a chute and the punched out sheet of polyester rolls beneath the chute,Relevant
Cutting the blanks from the sheet takes from two to four minutes depending on the size of the buttons being made,Relevant
The blanks at this stage are hot because the polyester is still reacting with the catalyst releasing heat,Relevant
So at this point the blanks are removed from the chute and poured into a nylon bag,Relevant
The bag is then lowered into a tank of salt water which is heated to 230 F 110 C ,Relevant
The blanks float in the salt water for 15 minutes,Relevant
The water slowly cools and the polyester blanks harden,Relevant
Next the nylon bag is transferred to a cold water tank and the blanks reach their final state of hardness,Relevant
After the hot and cold baths the blanks are dried in a centrifugal drying machine which spins them in a wire mesh basket,Relevant
The blanks are now ready to be cut into their finished button shape,Relevant
The exact design of the button can be specified by a clothing manufacturer and the button maker must make a steel cutting tool according to the design he is given,Relevant
A different cutting tool is needed for example to make a beveled edge or a flat one or to make a slightly concave button,Relevant
When the appropriate cutting tool is in place the buttons are poured into a hopper at the top of the cutting machine,Relevant
The blanks fall into a holder where they are clamped tightly and moved toward the cutting tool,Relevant
The spinning blade advances and cuts the button then retracts,Relevant
Next the button moves beneath a set of drills which create the holes,Relevant
Like the cutting tool the drills must be designed to conform to the clothing manufacturer s specifications,Relevant
The design specifies not only two holes or four holes but the diameter of the holes and the distance between them as well,Irrelevant
After the buttons pass beneath the drill they are sucked by vacuum out of the holder and into a box beneath the machine,Relevant
Hundreds of buttons a minute can be made this way though the number varies according to the size of the button and the complexity of the design,Relevant
After the buttons are cut and drilled they have rough or sharp edges scratches and tool marks,Relevant
They are placed into hexagonal tumbling drums which contain water an abrasive material and a foaming agent,Relevant
The drums spin for up to 24 hours,Relevant
The buttons bounce around in the drum until they are smooth and shiny,Relevant
After tumbling the buttons are washed and dried,Relevant
Optical glass is supplied to lens manufacturers by specialized vendors,Irrelevant
Usually it is provided as a pressed plate or sliced glass plate from which the elements are cut,Irrelevant
The glass elements are shaped to concave or convex forms by a curve generator machine that is a first step grinder,Relevant
To reach the specifications for its shape a lens goes through a sequence of processes in which it is ground by polishing particles in water,Relevant
The polishing particles become smaller in each step as the lens is refined,Relevant
Curve generation and subsequent grinding vary in speed depending on the frailty softness and oxidation properties of the optical materials,Relevant
After grinding and polishing the elements are centered so that the outer edge of the lens is perfect in circumference relative to the centerline or optical axis of the lens,Relevant
Lenses made of plastic or bonded glass and resin are produced by the same processes,Relevant
Bonded materials are used to make lenses with non spherical surfaces and these lenses are called hybrid aspherics,Irrelevant
The aspherical surfaces of these lenses are completed during centering 2 Formed lenses are coated to protect the material from oxidation to prevent reflections and to meet requirements for designed spectrum transmission or color balance and rendition,Relevant
The lens surfaces are carefully cleaned before coating,Relevant
Techniques for applying coatings and the coatings themselves are major selling points for a manufacturer s lenses and are carefully guarded secrets,Relevant
Some types of coatings include metal oxides light alloy fluorides and layers of quartz that are applied to lenses and mirrors by a vacuum process,Irrelevant
Several layers of coating may be applied for the best color and light transmission but excessive coating can reduce the light that passes through the lens and limit its usefulness,Relevant
The barrel includes the chassis that supports the various lens elements and the cosmetic exterior,Relevant
Metal mounts grooves and moving portions of the lens are critical to the performance of the lens and are machined to very specific tolerances,Relevant
Lens mounts may be made of brass aluminum or plastic,Irrelevant
Most metal barrel components are die cast and machined,Irrelevant
Metal mounts last longer maintain their dimensions can be machined more precisely and can be dismantled to replace elements if necessary,Irrelevant
Plastic mounts are less expensive and of lighter weight,Irrelevant
If the barrel is made of engineering plastic it is produced by a highly efficient and precise method of injection molding,Irrelevant
The interior surfaces of the barrel are also coated to protect them and to prevent internal reflection and flare,Irrelevant
Other parts of the lens such as the diaphragm and auto focus module are produced as subassemblies,Irrelevant
The iris diaphragm is constructed of curved leaves cut out of thin sheets of metal,Irrelevant
The metal leaves are held in place by two plates,Relevant
One plate is fixed the other moves and has slots for sliding pins,Irrelevant
These slide the leaves back toward the barrel to open the diaphragm or into the center to close the opening as the f stop ring is turned,Irrelevant
The diaphragm assembly is fastened into place when the lens mount is attached to the end of the barrel,Relevant
The auto focus is also added the optical elements are positioned and the lens is sealed,Relevant
After final assembly the lens is adjusted and inspected rigorously,Relevant
It must meet the design standards for optical resolution mechanical function and auto focus response,Relevant
Lenses may also be tested by subjecting them to shocks dropping and vibration,Relevant
Since most carpet in the U S is tufted earlier methods of weaving carpet such as Wilton and Axminster are ignored in the following account,Irrelevant
Synthetic yarns arrive at the carpet manufacturer either in staple fiber form or bulk Carpetcontinuous filament form,Irrelevant
The staple fibers which average 7 inches 18 cm long are loose individual strands that arrive in bales,Irrelevant
Several bales are blended together into one batch in a hopper,Relevant
Then after lubrication they are spun into long loose ropes called slivers by a carding machine,Relevant
The slivers are then pulled straightened and spun into single yarn that is wound onto spools,Relevant
Both the single ply staple fibers now spun into filament and the bulk continuous filament must now be twisted together to form thicker twoply yarn suitable for tufting,Irrelevant
The yarns are then steamed to bulk them and then heated to 270 280 F 132 138 C ,Relevant
This heat setting causes the yarn to maintain its shape by fixing its twist,Relevant
After cooling these yarns are wound onto tubes and transported to the tufting machines,Relevant
Most carpets are dyed after tufting yet sometimes the yarns are dyed first,Relevant
The methods include putting 500 1 000 pounds 227 455 kg of fiber into pressurized vats Carpetthrough which treated dyes are circulated or passing the fiber continuously through the bath or passing skeins of yarn through the vat of dye,Relevant
The yarn can also be put on forms and the heated dyes can then be forced under pressure from inside the forms to color the yarn,Relevant
Another method passes the yarn through printing rollers while yet another involves knitting the yarn onto a form that is then printed with dyes before the yarn is unraveled,Relevant
All yarn that has been dyed is then steamed washed and dried,Relevant
The yarn is put on a creel a bar with skewers behind the tufting machine then fed into a nylon tube that leads to the tufting needle,Relevant
The needle pierces the primary backing and pushes the yarn down into a loop,Relevant
Photoelectric sensors control how deeply the needles plunge into the backing so the height of the loops can be controlled,Irrelevant
A looper or flat hook seizes and releases the loop of yarn while the needle pulls back up the backing is shifted forward and the needle once more pierces the backing further on,Irrelevant
To make cut pile a looper facing the opposite direction is fitted with a knife that acts like a pair of scissors snipping the loop,Relevant
This process is carried out by several hundred needles up to 1 200 across the 12 foot [3 7 ml width and several hundred rows of stitches are carried out per minute,Relevant
One tufting machine can thus produce several hundred square yards of carpet a day,Irrelevant
For solid color carpeting carpet of several standard roll lengths is sewn together to make a continuous roll which is then fed into a vat,Irrelevant
The vat is filled with water which is first heated before dyes and chemicals are mixed in,Relevant
The mixture is then slowly brought to a boil and cooked for four hours,Relevant
Another method of making solid color carpet is to sew several rows together to make one continuous roll which is then fed under rods that bleed the color into the pile,Irrelevant
After dyeing the carpet is then steamed to fix the color excess color is washed off and the carpet is dried and put on a roll,Relevant
To make printed carpet of various designs white carpet passes under screens in which holes in the desired pattern have been cut,Relevant
The desired color is squeegeed through the holes in the screen and the carpet is advanced 36 inches 91 cm to a different screen that applies a new color in a different design through the screen,Relevant
Up to eight colors can be applied with this method,Irrelevant
Another method of dyeing printed carpet is to pass it under embossed cylinders that have raised portions in a design which press color into the carpet,Irrelevant
Each cylinder provides a different design for a different color,Irrelevant
After dyeing the printed carpet is steamed excess dyes are washed off and the carpet is then dried and put onto rolls to go to the finishing department,Relevant
The ends of the dyed carpet are first sewn together to form a continuous belt,Relevant
This belt is then rolled under a dispenser that spreads a coating of latex onto the bottom of the carpet,Relevant
At the same time a strong secondary backing is also coated with latex,Relevant
Both of these are then rolled onto a marriage roller which forms them into a sandwich and seals them together,Relevant
The carpet is then placed in an oven to cure the latex,Relevant
The completed carpet is then steamed brushed vacuumed and run through a machine that clips off any tufts that rise above its uniform surface,Relevant
The carpet is then rolled into 120 foot 37 m lengths that are then packaged in strong plastic and shipped to either the carpet manufacturer s inventory warehouse or to a retail carpet store,Relevant
Cat litter made from wood paper grain corncobs citrus and grass account for only 5% of today s market,Irrelevant
The restabout 95% of all cat litteris clay based,Irrelevant
Cat box fillers contain few ingredients and the entire production process is performed by the manufacturers who mine dry and size their own clay,Irrelevant
Various kinds of clay are found through out the United States especially in Alabama southern California southern Illinois eastern Kansas Nevada Oregon southeastern Texas and Wyoming,Irrelevant
Clay is found approximately 30 40 feet 9 12 m below the surface and earth movers scoop it from open pits,Relevant
The raw clay is then transported to the plant,Relevant
The clay is loaded onto conveyor belts and spilled into giant crushers,Relevant
The crushers break the clay into smaller pieces then deposit them onto another conveyor belt which feeds the clay into a kiln,Relevant
The kiln resembles a horizontal chimney or sewer pipe 100 feet 30 m or more in length,Relevant
Inside the kiln where temperatures can reach 2000 F 1093 C lifters tumble the clay as it bakes,Relevant
The clay continues its baking process until it has traveled the entire length of the kiln,Relevant
As the clay emerges from the kiln it is fed into a second crusher,Relevant
Here rollers crumble the clay to its final consistency,Relevant
Next the granules pass through an enclosed machine that contains a series of screens stacked one on top of another,Relevant
Here the various sizes of granules are sorted,Relevant
Because litter is less absorbent when granules are the same size the sorting process ensures that an assortment of sizes are represented,Relevant
Clumping litter which are ground to a smaller size than conventional litter are frequently blended with sodium bentonite a naturally swelling clay known for its absorbent qualities,Relevant
A dust controlling agent is then added to the ground clay to prevent the dust created when particles rub against one another from becoming airborne,Relevant
Most cat litter manufacturers also add deodorizers to prevent odors,Irrelevant
The glass envelope or its components are usually formed at a glass manufacturing facility and shipped to the cathode ray tube manufacturer who forms the phosphor viewing screen fabricates and assembles the electron gun and assembles the finished CRT,Irrelevant
The glass ingredients are weighed and mixed prior to melting,Relevant
The glass is melted in gas fired furnaces about 500 3 000 square feet 46 279 sq m in size,Relevant
If this is a continuous process new ingredients are added to maintain a constant level as the molten glass flows out of the furnace to the forming areas,Relevant
Before forming the molten glass must be cooled somewhat and made uniform in temperature throughout,Relevant
The face plate is normally pressed into the desired shape by dropping a gob of molten glass into a mold and pressing on the gob with a plunger,Relevant
The funnel can be formed either by pressing or by centrifugal casting,Irrelevant
In the casting method a gob of molten glass drops into a mold which then spins rapidly to spread the glass uniformly over the inside surface of the mold,Relevant
A grooving disk near the top of the mold cuts the soft glass at the desired height so that the excess glass can be removed easily,Relevant
The neck is made from glass tubing and one end is flared to facilitate insertion of the electron gun,Relevant
In a monochromatic CRT the three glass components are joined together before they are shipped to the CRT manufacturer,Irrelevant
In a color CRT only the neck and funnel are joined and the face plate is shipped separately for further processing,Irrelevant
The glass components are usually joined by heating the mating surfaces to a high temperature with gas jets or electric heaters,Relevant
In monochromatic CRTs the phosphor viewing surface is coated on the inside of the glass face plate,Relevant
This is done by preparing a liquid suspension of the phosphor and pouring a measured amount into the neck of the glass envelope along with a gelling agent,Relevant
After about 20 minutes the coating has set and the excess liquid is poured off,Relevant
The process for color CRTs is more complicated,Irrelevant
First the shadow mask is made by applying a light sensitive coating to the thin mask material exposing it to light through a perforated template and then etching away the exposed coating with an acid to form the millions of holes,Relevant
The mask is then pressed into a slightly curved shape and attached just behind the face plate,Relevant
The face plate is placed in a centrifuge and the inside surface is coated with the green phosphor material,Relevant
The centrifuge spins the face plate to ensure an even coating of phosphor,Relevant
A strong ultraviolet light is shown through the mask to harden the green phosphor material into hundreds of thousands of dots,Relevant
The remaining material is then washed off,Relevant
This process is repeated to form the red and blue phosphor dots with the ultraviolet light being shifted a small amount each time,Relevant
When this process is finished the glass face plate is joined to the funnel,Relevant
On color tubes the phosphor dots are sensitive to high temperatures so instead of using high temperature gas jets a mixture of chemical solvent and powdered glass called a frit is applied to the joint,Irrelevant
This acts like a glass solder and the joint can be sealed at a much lower temperature,Irrelevant
The metal components of the electron gun are precision formed,Relevant
If coils are used they are wound from fine copper wire,Irrelevant
Some electron guns use metal plates instead of coils and these plates are stamped and formed,Relevant
The components are assembled either by hand or with automated machines in a clean environment,Relevant
The glass tube is sealed into the base and the base is welded into the gun assembly,Relevant
The inside of the glass envelope neck is lubricated with graphite and the electron gun is inserted and aligned,Relevant
The neck is then sealed around the gun,Relevant
A vacuum pump is attached to the glass tube extending from the rear of the gun and the inside of the CRT is evacuated of air,Relevant
When the proper vacuum has been achieved the glass tube is heated and quickly pinched closed to form a seal,Relevant
The finished CRT is tested for performance and carefully packed to prevent damage,Relevant
Because the CRT is under a high vacuum any fracture in the glass envelope could result in an inward explosion known as an implosion,Relevant
The manufacture of chalkboards begins when large sheets of steel in desired sizes enter the manufacturing facility from an outside supplier,Relevant
This steel is cold rolled and inspected for irregularities upon arrival,Relevant
Next the large sheets are sent into a chemical washer,Relevant
This chamber washes rinses and dries the steel,Relevant
When this step is completed the steel is again inspected for flaws and imperfections,Relevant
Next a slip is applied to the sheets of steel,Relevant
A slip is a mixture of clay or another organic compound applied to a surface during the manufacture of porcelain or other ceramics,Relevant
In this case the slip is usually made from silica and applied to both sides of the steel sheet by passing it through a coating chamber,Relevant
The coating must be at least 0 0025 inches 062 mm thick,Relevant
The slip is set aside to dry,Relevant
The sheets once again pass through an inspection process before they are transferred to the ground coat furnace area,Relevant
This ground coat area of the manufacturing facility typically houses a large furnace chamber,Relevant
The sheets of steel are fed into the chamber and subjected to high temperatures,Relevant
This softens the steel and allows fusion of the slip with the steel,Relevant
This is a crucial step in all porcelain manufacturing and fabrication of industrial ceramics,Irrelevant
Once the newly porcelained material leaves the furnace it is treated with a surface coating compound,Relevant
Typically this compound is derived from glass opacifiers and imparts a smoother texture to the board,Relevant
Oxides for color may also be added,Relevant
Again this coating must be at least 0 0025 inches 062 mm thick,Relevant
The boards are once again sent to a drying area,Relevant
After they are completely cooled and dried they are once again inspected for surface blemishes and uniformity of color,Relevant
Next the boards are placed in a cover coat furnace,Relevant
The purpose of this heating process is to fuse the first ground coat with the surface coat,Relevant
A temperature of at least 1200 F 649 C is needed to successfully complete this process,Relevant
Next the chalkboards are passed through a cooling chamber which gradually reduces the temperature of the steel so that the flat sheets do not buckle or weaken which might occur if left to cool by themselves,Relevant
Next the surface of the chalkboard is laminated onto a fiberboard,Relevant
This backing material must be at least 0 44 11 mm inch thick,Relevant
A special adhesive is used for this application,Relevant
In the next few steps the finishing touches are put on the board,Relevant
A wood or aluminum trim is added to the edges to make a border and accessories such as chalktrays map rails and hooks and flag holders are attached,Relevant
Tobacco is initially grown in outdoor frames called seedbeds,Irrelevant
In warm regions the frames are covered with mulch or a cotton top sheet in cooler regions glass or plastic shields are installed to protect the plants,Irrelevant
After 8 10 weeks when the seedlings are almost 10 inches 25 cm tall they are transplanted to the fields,Relevant
Although transplanting machines are available the vast majority of the world s tobacco plants are still planted manually,Irrelevant
As the plants grow the heads are broken off by hand so the leaves will grow fuller a process called topping,Relevant
The plants stay in the field 90 120 days before they are harvested,Irrelevant
Tobacco plants are harvested by one of two methods priming or stalk cutting,Irrelevant
In the priming method the leaves are gathered and brought to a curing bam as they ripen,Relevant
In the stalk cutting method the entire plant is cut and the plants are allowed to Cigarettewilt in the field before being taken to the curing barn,Relevant
Next the leaves are carefully gradually dried in a specially constructed barn by air curing flue curing or fire curing,Relevant
Air curing uses natural weather conditions to dry tobacco,Relevant
Stalks are hung in a barn with ventilators that can be opened and closed to control temperature and humidity,Relevant
Artificial heat is used only during cold or excessively humid weather,Relevant
The stalks are hung for four to eight weeks,Irrelevant
Flue curing is done in small tightly constructed barns that are artificially heated,Irrelevant
The heat comes from flues metal pipes that are attached to furnaces,Relevant
Open oil and gas burners are sometimes used but this method is problematic because smoke can not come in direct contact with the tobacco,Irrelevant
Flue curing takes about four to six days,Irrelevant
Fire curing dries tobacco with low burning wood fires whose smoke comes in direct contact with the leaves thus producing a smoky flavor and aroma,Relevant
The tobacco is allowed to dry naturally in the barn for three to five days before it is fire dried for 3 40 days,Relevant
Unless humid weather conditions eliminate the need the brittle cured tobacco leaves must be conditioned in moistening chambers so they do not break when they are handled,Irrelevant
After moistening the tobacco is stripped,Relevant
During this process the leaves are sprayed with additional moisture as a precaution against cracking or breaking,Relevant
After the leaves are moistened and stripped they are sorted into grades based on size color and quality and tied in bundles for shipment,Relevant
The farmers then bring the tobacco to warehouses where it is placed in baskets weighed graded once again by a government inspector and finally auctioned to cigarette manufacturers,Relevant
After they have purchased and transported the material to their factories manufacturers treat and age the tobacco to enhance its flavor,Relevant
First the manufacturer Cigaretteredries the tobacco,Relevant
This involves completely drying the leaves by air and then adding a uniform amount of moisture,Relevant
Packed into barrels called hogsheads the tobacco is then aged for one to three years during which period it develops its flavor and aroma,Relevant
After it is aged the tobacco leaves are again moistened and the stalks and other wastes removed,Relevant
Leaves from different types of tobacco are mixed to create a particular flavor,Relevant
After blending the tobacco leaves are pressed into cakes and mechanically shredded,Relevant
Materials such as fruit juices or menthol are added to give additional flavor,Relevant
The final shredded tobacco is then dispersed over a continuous roll of cigarette paper,Relevant
A machine rolls the shredded tobacco into the paper and cuts it to the desired length,Relevant
A device then grabs each cigarette and fastens a filter in one end,Relevant
Modern cigarette machines can produce 25 30 cigarettes a second,Irrelevant
The final stage of cigarette manufacture is packaging,Relevant
The completed cigarettes are packed 20 to a package,Relevant
The hard or soft packs are mechanically sealed in cellophane and hand placed in cartons,Relevant
The actual manufacturing process proceeds as follows,Irrelevant
The base of the machine is either cast or welded together,Irrelevant
It is then heat treated to remove casting or welding stresses and to normalize the metal for machining,Irrelevant
The base is fixtured into a large machining center and the mounting areas for the ways are machined to specification,Relevant
The ways are ground flat bolted and pinned to the base,Relevant
The mechanisms that move the bed or spindle are called ballscrews,Relevant
These change rotary motion of the drive motors into linear motion and consist of a screw shaft and support bearings,Relevant
As the shaft turns a bearing mount follows the spiral grooves in the shaft and produces a very accurate linear movement that moves either the worktable under the spindle or the spindle carrier itself,Relevant
These ballscrews are bolted to the base with the bearing mount bolted to the worktable or spindle carrier,Relevant
The spindle is machined and ground mounted to its drive motor and then bolted to the movable spindle carrier,Relevant
Each axis of motion has a separate ballscrew and set of ways in most machining centers,Irrelevant
The computer or controller is an electronic assembly separate from the rest of the machine,Irrelevant
It has a climate controlled enclosure mounted on the side of the frame or in an operator s console,Relevant
It contains all of the operating memory computer boards power supplies and other electronic circuitry to operate the machine,Irrelevant
Assorted wiring connects the controller to the machine motors and positional slides,Irrelevant
The CNC Machine Toolslides continuously send the axis location information to the controller so the exact position of the worktable in relationship to the spindle is always known,Irrelevant
The front of the controller has a video screen that displays the program information position speeds and feeds and other data required for the operator to monitor the machine s performance,Irrelevant
Also on the front panel are the data entry keys data connection ports and start stop switches,Irrelevant
The assembled machine is test run for accuracy,Irrelevant
Each machine has slight physical differences that are mathematically corrected in the computer operating system,Relevant
These correction values are stored in a separate memory and the machine checks these continuously,Relevant
As the machining center wears from use these parameters can be recalibrated to assure accuracy,Relevant
After testing the finished machine is painted and prepared for shipment,Relevant
When a new coin has been commissioned sculptors employed by the mint develop a set of sketches,Relevant
When one particular sketch has been approved and refined the sculptor creates a clay model,Relevant
The model can be anywhere from three to twelve times larger than the actual coin,Irrelevant
Plaster is poured over the clay model to create a negative or reverse plaster model,Relevant
The words of the inscriptions are carved into the plaster in reverse,Relevant
The sculptor repeats this process several times until the plaster model is perfect,Relevant
Next a durable rubber mold is made by pouring epoxy into the plaster mold,Relevant
The epoxy mold is mounted onto a transferengraver,Relevant
At one end of the transfer engraver a stylus traces the epoxy mold,Relevant
As the stylus moves a ratio bar in the middle of the engraver reduces the design to the actual coin size,Relevant
This reduced size is communicated to a carbide tool at the opposite end which then cuts the design into a steel blank,Relevant
The result is a positive replica called a master hub,Irrelevant
The sculptors examine the master hub and remove any imperfections 4 Heat treated metal is placed under a computerized lathe where it is smoothed Coinand polished into a precisely measured blank die The master hub is pressed into the die The result is called the master die,Relevant
The master die is used to create working hubs and working dies The master hubs and dies are then placed in storage 5 The appropriate coil of metal is fed through a blanking press which punches out round disks corresponding in size to the coin to be minted The blanks are cut at a speed of 400 strokes per minute The leftover scraps of metal are shredded and recycled for future use 6 The blanks are subjected to another annealing process and then placed in industrial washing machines and dryers The lubricants used in these various processes cause the blanks to become stained and oxidized 7 The blanks are next placed into revolving tubs or barrels filled with an acidic pickling agent As the blanks are tossed together in the tubs they become burnished Sorting and weeding the blanks 8 The blanks are sifted through a riddler a metal sheet fitted with holes that match the exact size of the particular coin to be minted,Relevant
In this manner misshapen and odd sized blanks are weeded out,Irrelevant
The perfect blanks are carried by conveyer belt to the coining press where they are stamped with designs and inscriptions,Irrelevant
A steel collar is inserted into the press around one of the dies,Relevant
The die for the reverse side is loaded into the upper arm of the press,Relevant
Hundreds of tons of air pressure push the blank into the collar,Relevant
At the same time the overhead die is forced down into the collar and onto the blank,Relevant
The impact causes the impressions to form on both sides of the blank,Relevant
The press releases the newly minted coin and it moves along a conveyer belt to the inspection line,Relevant
In some instances the collar has grooves to make the ridged edges on the coin,Irrelevant
Otherwise the grooves are made after the striking process on a tool called an upsetting mill,Irrelevant
The size of the press varies from single capacity to ones that stamp four coins simultaneously,Irrelevant
Single striking presses generally stamp 400 coins per minute with pressure loads up to 180 tons,Irrelevant
Multiple presses can crank out 120 coins per minute under 250 tons of pressure,Irrelevant
The press operator spot checks each batch of new coins with a magnifying glass,Relevant
The coins move through another riddler that sorts out blanks that have become misshapen or dented during the striking process,Relevant
An automatic counting machine spits I out a predetermined amount of coins and drops them into large canvas bags,Relevant
The bags are sewn shut loaded onto pallets and then moved by forklift trucks to storage vaults,Relevant
Rubber latex is obtained from the milky fluid produced by various tropical plants,Irrelevant
Latex is actually an emulsion or dispersion of tiny rubber particles in water and ingredients added to the latex must be able to attach to the rubber particles during compounding,Relevant
Next chemical additives are mixed to form a paste,Relevant
This paste is then blended with the liquid latex in a process called compounding,Relevant
The latex and chemical compound is then unloaded into drums for storage where it remains for approximately seven days,Relevant
During this period vulcanization chemically strengthens the bonds of the rubber,Relevant
The storage time also allows any Condomair which might have been trapped in the mixture during compounding to escape,Irrelevant
The compound is then added to the dipping or condom forming machine,Relevant
The dipping machine is a long hooded machine approximately 100 feet 30 5 m in length,Irrelevant
Thick tempered glass rods move along a closed belt between two circular gears,Relevant
The belt drags the rods which are called mandrels through a series of dips into the latex compound,Relevant
The mandrels rotate to spread the latex evenly,Relevant
Several coats are required to build the condom to its required thickness,Relevant
Between each dip the latex is hot air dried,Relevant
After the final dipping and drying the condoms automatically roll off the mandrels,Relevant
A machine shapes and trims the ring of latex at the base of each condom,Relevant
Next the condoms are put in a tumbling machine where they are coated with talc or another similar powder to prevent the rubber from sticking to itself,Relevant
After a curing period of several days the condoms are sampled by batch and tested for leaks and strength,Relevant
The first such test is the inflation test in which the condom is filled with air until it bursts,Relevant
Condoms are required to stretch beyond 1 5 cubic feet about the size of a watermelon before bursting,Irrelevant
In the water leakage test the condom is filled with 10 ounces 300 ml of water and inspected for pin sized holes by rolling it along blotter paper,Relevant
Condoms are also tested electronically,Relevant
This involves mounting each condom on a charged stainless steel mandrel,Irrelevant
The mandrel is passed over by a soft conductive brush,Relevant
If pin holes are present a circuit will be established with the mandrel and the machine will automatically reject the condom,Relevant
Condoms that have successfully passed these tests are rolled by a machine,Relevant
Rolling the condom makes it easier to package and use,Relevant
Lubricant and spermicide may be applied by a metering pump just before the top wrap is added in the foiling process,Relevant
Molding the lens can be carried out in several different ways,Irrelevant
The lenses first developed in Prague were spin cast,Irrelevant
Three different fluids were poured into open rotating molds,Irrelevant
The outside curvature of the lens was shaped by the mold and the inside curvature was formed according to the speed of the rotation of the mold,Irrelevant
The centrifugal force of the spinning mold led to the polymerization of the fluids so that the molecular chains linked to form the required hydrophilic plastic,Irrelevant
A more reliable mass production Contact Lensmethod is injection molding,Irrelevant
In injection molding the molten plastic is injected into the mold under pressure,Relevant
Then the lens is removed from the mold and cooled,Relevant
The lens is then finished on a lathe,Relevant
It is also possible to produce lenses entirely through molding that is they need no lathe cutting,Irrelevant
This is a recent development made possible through highly automated computer controlled mold production,Irrelevant
The initial forming of the lens can also be done by cutting on a lathe,Relevant
First a blank is made,Relevant
The blank is a circle only slightly larger than the size of the finished lens,Irrelevant
This can be cut from a plastic rod or stamped from a plastic sheet,Irrelevant
Next the blank is fastened to a steel button with a drop of molten wax,Relevant
The button is then centered on a lathe which begins to spin at high speed,Relevant
A cutting tool which may be a diamond or a laser makes concave cuts in the blank to form the CPC,Relevant
Indicators on the lathe measure the depth of the cuts to guide the lens operator,Relevant
The button holding the blank is next moved to a lapping machine,Relevant
The lapping machine holds the blank against a lapper which is a revolving disk coated with an abrasive compound,Relevant
The shape of the lapper matches the CPC of the lens,Relevant
The lapping machine spins the blank in one direction and the lapper in the other,Relevant
It also moves the blank in a small figure eight motion,Relevant
The abrasion polishes the lens surface,Relevant
The polished lens is then mounted on a steel shaft called an arbor,Relevant
The end of the arbor has been ground to match the CPC so the lens will fit on the shaft,Relevant
The arbor is installed in a lathe and the operator makes convex cuts in the lens to form the other major curve the CAC,Relevant
Now this side of the lens is polished and the lapper is modified to fit the convex CAC,Relevant
When this second side of the lens is polished the lens is considered semi finished,Relevant
The contact lens requires several more curves to be ground before the lens will fit exactly on the patient s eye,Irrelevant
The final curves are the peripheral anterior and posterior curves and the intermediate anterior and posterior curves which govern the shape of the lens nearest and next nearest the edge,Irrelevant
The lens is mounted on an arbor again by suction or with double sided tape,Relevant
The arbor is installed in the lathe or grinding machine,Relevant
These shallower cuts may be ground with emery paper or cut with a razor blade,Irrelevant
The diameter of the lens may also be trimmed at this time,Irrelevant
Quality control is very important for contact lenses since they are medical devices and they must be custom fit,Irrelevant
The lenses are inspected after each stage of the manufacturing process,Relevant
The lenses are examined under magnification for anomalies,Relevant
They are also measured by means of a shadow graph,Relevant
A magnified shadow of the lens is cast on a screen imprinted with a graph for measuring diameter and curvature,Relevant
Any errors in the lens shape show up in the shadow,Relevant
This process may be automatically performed by computer,Irrelevant
After the lens has passed inspection it is sterilized,Relevant
Lens are boiled in a mixture of water and salt for several hours to soften the lens,Relevant
Next the lens are packaged,Relevant
Standard packaging for lenses is a glass vial filled with a saline solution and stoppered with rubber or metal,Relevant
The hydrophilic material of soft contact lenses soaks up the saline solution which is similar to human tears and becomes soft and pliable,Relevant
The lenses in this state are ready to wear,Relevant
Once the leather has been selected the process of making the top part of the boot begins by cutting out the individual pieces,Relevant
This might be done by hand in custom shops but in factories it is done by metal dies which work like cookie cutters,Relevant
The top of a boot consists of three parts the part that covers the top of the foot the part that encloses the back of the heel and the part that fits around the bottom of the shins,Irrelevant
These are called respectively the vamp the counter and the uppers,Irrelevant
The vamp is like the top and sides of an ordinary man s shoe but it is one piece instead of several without lace holes and a separate tongue,Irrelevant
The counter covers what the vamp does not,Irrelevant
The uppers are cut in two pieces one for the front and one for the back designed to join each other at the sides,Relevant
At this stage the lining for the inside of each of these pieces is cut out and then glued into place,Relevant
The lining is particularly important for boots made of fragile skins such as snake or eel for the leather backing will provide most of the strength,Irrelevant
If the boot is to have any kind of stitched decorationwhether a simple Cowboy Bootspattern or an elaborate picture such as a yellow rose an oil derrick or the state of Texasthis is done before the pieces are assembled,Irrelevant
In custom shops the design is sketched on a paper pattern or stencil and then outlined with a series of small holes,Irrelevant
This stencil is laid over each piece and then sprinkled with a marking agent such as white powder so the design can be followed by someone operating a sewing machine,Relevant
Factories tend to use computerized sewing machines for this task with preprogrammed designs so marking the leather isn t necessary,Irrelevant
Any additional colors the design requires are dyed into the leather at this stage,Relevant
The boot is initially assembled in two halves front and back,Relevant
The vamp the part that covers the top and sides of the foot is sewn to the front upper the counter the part that covers the heel is sewn to the back upper,Relevant
Excess leather around the stitching is then trimmed off,Relevant
A long strip of leather called the welt is then attached to the back of the counter and left hanging there,Irrelevant
The welt will be used at a later stage to attach the top of the boot to the sole,Relevant
The front and back halves of the boot are then glued and sewn together,Relevant
These seams are made first on the inside so the boot initially takes shape inside out like a shirt,Relevant
Leather is however harder to work than cotton and once the seams are made the top of the boot must be soaked in water until the leather is flexible enough to be turned right outside out again,Irrelevant
At the end of this stage the top part of the boot is complete in a custom shop the work of a top man would now be done,Relevant
The first step in building the bottom of the boot is attaching the insole to the vamp and the counter,Relevant
The insole in any shoe or boot is the part you see when looking down inside it it often bears the imprint of the maker s name,Irrelevant
A key component in this part of the process is the last,Irrelevant
The last is basically a model of a footan anatomically accurate version of a shoetreewhich is left inside the boot during the rest of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
In a factory lasts are standard sizes and generally made of molded plastic,Irrelevant
In custom shops they are made of hardwood and adjusted to the precise shape of an individual s foot,Irrelevant
The workshop of these bootmakers may contain Cowboy Bootsthousands of lasts hanging from the walls and ceilings available for the customers they expect to reorder,Irrelevant
The insole is first tacked to the last,Relevant
Then the vamp and the counter are nailed over the insole into the lastfirst in front at the toe and then working around on both sides towards the back,Relevant
At this point a stiff piece of leather is inserted at the front of the vamp to reinforce the boot at the toe,Relevant
The welt which has been hanging on the back of the counter since the top was first made is then sewn onto the vamp and the insole,Relevant
The boot is now almost complete lacking only a heel and a sole,Relevant
Because the welt now binds together the insole the vamp and the counter the nails that tacked the leather to the last are no longer necessary,Irrelevant
The nails are removed but the last remains inside the boot until it is finished,Relevant
A metal shank is then attached to the insole to reinforce the high arch it is held in place by a piece of leather,Relevant
The sole is shaped to fit the insole and then stitched to the welt,Relevant
The heel is then nailed on and then both the heel and the sole are shaped by sanding,Relevant
The finishing process gives the boot its final appearance,Irrelevant
The last is removed and a boot tree is used to make fine adjustments in the shape of the boot,Relevant
Seams are trimmed and stray threads cut short,Relevant
Final dyes are applied if necessary and then the boot is waxed and polished,Relevant
The boots are checked for quality at this stage though the standards of quality control vary between factories and custom shops,Relevant
In a custom shop how the boot fits an individual customer will distinguish an approved product from one that may need to be reworked or rejected,Irrelevant
But with both kinds of manufacturing the number of stitches per inch is important as is the quality of the leather and the strength of the welt,Irrelevant
In the American market the predominant manufacturer is the Binney   Smith Company of Pennsylvania which manufactures more than two billion crayons a year,Irrelevant
The paraffin is pumped into supply tanks outside the crayon factory,Relevant
Each tank holds about 17 000 gallons 65 875 1 of liquid,Irrelevant
When the process begins the paraffin is piped into small heated tubs with a volume of about 6 gallons 23 1 about the size of a home washing machine ,Irrelevant
At the same time or soon after a pigment or mixture of pigments is added to give a batch of crayons a particular color,Relevant
Paraffin is pumped into supply tanks outside the crayon factory,Relevant
Each tank holds about 17 000 gallons of liquid,Irrelevant
When the process begins the paraffin is piped into small heated tubs with a volume of about 6 gallons,Relevant
The paraffin wets the pigments as they are mixed and the mixing disperses the pigment uniformly,Relevant
When the combination of paraffin and color is fully blended the batch is automatically pumped out of the tubs into molds of the desired shape,Relevant
Rotating blades inside the mold prevent the formation of bubbles and lumps as the mixture cools,Relevant
The molds are cooled as water circulates around them,Relevant
The color of the crayon and thus the type and quantity of pigment used can affect the time needed for cooling,Irrelevant
Some colors will be ready for the next step within four minutes other colors can take as much as seven minutes,Irrelevant
The molds used for the crayons might hold as many as 2 400 forms,Irrelevant
Until recently the paraffin pigment mixtures were poured by hand from the tubs into a bucket and then into molds,Irrelevant
Newer machinery now automates the process and pumps the mixture directly into the molds,Relevant
In some large older factories both processes might be used,Irrelevant
After cooling the crayons are automatically pushed out of the molds and inspected,Relevant
Inspectors examine each crayon for breaks and chips as well as signs of bubbles in the cooled crayon a condition that occurs if mixing has not been complete,Relevant
Rejected crayons are returned to the tubs for remelting and recasting,Relevant
Crayons that have passed the quality control inspection are automatically placed into racks where they are wrapped with paper labels most manufacturers use a double wrapping of paper to give the crayons added strength,Relevant
Crayons are automatically filled into boxes and sent to wholesalers,Relevant
In the early days of crayon manufacture an entire factory floor might be devoted to the production of a single color for a day or more,Irrelevant
Following that color s molding machines would be cleaned and a new color would be made,Relevant
In today s factory the demand for crayons is so huge and the number of different colors so great easily more than 100 that individual vats and molds are dedicated to only one or only a few colors and the production lines run day and night,Irrelevant
The process begins by soaking strips of paper in resin,Relevant
Decorative plastic laminates can be made in different grades or thicknesses depending on its intended use,Irrelevant
There may be from 7 18 layers of paper combined into the final sheet,Irrelevant
The bottom layers are kraft paper,Irrelevant
The paper comes in ribbons of different widths commonly of three four or five feet,Irrelevant
The kraft paper is run through a bath tub or vat containing phenolic resins,Irrelevant
The paper for the top layer of the sheet is translucent,Irrelevant
This is run through a vat of melamine resin,Relevant
The layer just beneath the top is the decorative layer,Relevant
This is a sheet of paper printed with the color or design that will show through the clear top layer for the desired surface pattern,Relevant
This sheet is also run through a melamine vat,Relevant
The resin impregnated sheets are then put into a drying chamber,Relevant
Next they are cut and stacked in layers,Relevant
The clear layer and the decorative layer are on top of the kraft paper,Irrelevant
The layers of paper are then loaded onto a flat bed hydraulic press for final curing,Relevant
The press compresses the sandwich of resin soaked paper at 1 400 psi while heating it to a high temperature,Relevant
The heat catalyzes a reaction in the resins,Relevant
The phenol or melamine and formaldehyde molecules Decorative Plastic Laminateattach to each other in an alternatingchain fashion releasing water molecules in the process,Irrelevant
The resins flow together and then set,Relevant
Thermosetting converts the paper sheets into one single rigid laminated sheet,Relevant
This sheet is dry and insoluble and it cannot be shaped or molded even at high temperatures,Relevant
The dry sheet is cut into the desired size and shape,Relevant
It may also be bonded to a building material such as plywood flakeboard fiberboard or metal,Irrelevant
To make floss from nylon nylon salt is polymerized and the resulting polymer is poured out as a ribbon,Relevant
Next it is cut into small chips flakes or pellets,Relevant
These are blended remelted and pumped through spinnerets to form filaments,Relevant
When the nylon cools the filaments solidify and regather to form a yarn,Irrelevant
The ends of the filaments are combined to create one strand of floss,Relevant
Correctly twisting the nylon is a vital part of this process the turns average between 2 5 and 3 5 per inch,Irrelevant
Twisting adds strength to the floss as well as greatly reducing fraying or breaking,Irrelevant
Since floss consists of many filaments it can be produced in different decitexes,Irrelevant
Dental floss is commonly made out of one of two synthetic compounds nylon or Teflon Decitex is defined as the weight of 10 000 meters of unwaxed nylon in grams Floss is also measured by Denier,Irrelevant
Denier is defined as the weight of 9 000 meters of uncoated floss in grams There is a direct correlation between the numerical value of the decitex or denier and the thickness of the strand of floss if this value increases the thickness of the strand also increases 2 To produce a Teflon dental floss a polymer of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE is formulated Next the polymer is melted into a paste and stretched into a long thin strand The polymer is then expanded into one or more directions The PTFE is cut forming different deniers After the PTFE is processed its tensile strength is substantial Unlike multi filament nylon flosses PTFE is a monofilament which does not shred or break easily Therefore twisting is not required for this process The rates of stretching during the manufacturing process give this floss its added strength 3 This process allows manufacturers to differentiate their products by permeating the floss with distinctive and proprietary coatings The coating takes place in emulsion baths where the floss is pulled through waxes flavors and other desired coatings at a consistent velocity 4 Floss bobbins are next wound in one of two shapes cylindrical or roll type Winding the floss bobbins requires the use of equipment that transfers the yarn from one type of spool to another type A cylindrical bobbin is dispensed through a tube or rectangular shaped package It can be wound where the floss is pulled through the center or pulled from the outer layer first The advantage to this type of bobbin is that it can accommodate more yardage The roll bobbin is the more conventional type of floss bobbin It is dispensed through flat containers by pulling from the outer layer only 5 The standard case for nylon flosses is an angled two piece construction usually polypropylene with an insert that holds the floss spool Recently many manufacturers have opted to upgrade their floss dispensers by using a one piece clam shell construction that incorporates a window to gauge product use as well as grooves to facilitate gripping,Irrelevant
Floss bobbins are usually assembled manually into the floss container,Irrelevant
The bobbin cores are cut to separate them,Relevant
Next they are placed into the container the floss is threaded around a metal cutting clip and the cover is closed,Relevant
The package is now ready for labeling or if the container is pre decorated it is ready for packing and shipping,Relevant
There are three basic methods of decoration pad printing labeling and thermal transfer,Relevant
Pad printing is the most prevalent form of decorating used in the U S ,Irrelevant
Labeling is the preferred choice for most product exported to Europe,Irrelevant
Thermal transfer generates an image quality equal to or better than the pad printing image with the advantage that it allows for a greater range of colors and designs,Irrelevant
Marketers prefer blister packaging a plastic mold affixed to a cardboard backing which can hang on a display peg because it prominently displays the package and eliminates the need for paper packaging which is deemed better for the environment,Irrelevant
Another packaging trend is to co pack floss along with a toothbrush toothpaste or mouthwash,Irrelevant
Block caving is the most commonly used method in excavating diamonds from kimberlite deposits,Irrelevant
This method offers the highest yield and thus is the most cost effective,Irrelevant
First a large vertical hole is excavated typically 1 750 feet 533 m in diameter,Relevant
Levels are placed approximately every 40 feet 12 m ,Relevant
Along these levels are horizontal tunnels known as scraper drifts,Irrelevant
In the drifts there are small inclined coneshaped openings at intervals of every 11 feet 3 m or so,Irrelevant
These openings are roughly four feet by four feet,Irrelevant
When a horizontal slice is cut above the conesusually about six feet 1 8 m in heightthe kimberlite begins to break off and fall into the cone and into the scraper drift,Relevant
The material is then pushed onto trucks,Relevant
The trucks travel underground through the mining area and take the collected kimberlite to a crushing device,Relevant
In the crushing operation which occurs in the below ground mining facilities large chunks of kimberlite are broken up into more easily transportable segments,Relevant
After an initial crushing the kimberlite passes through a grizzly or a set of iron bars,Relevant
If the crushed chunks do not pass through the grizzly they are still too large and they are sent back for further crushing,Relevant
The crushed kimberlite is then taken above the surface for further processing,Relevant
When no more kimberlite is found entering the cones the area is depleted and work moves on to a lower level,Relevant
The actual diamonds must be separated from the rock that surrounds them,Irrelevant
Crushing or milling the excavated material is the first step but this is done in a rudimentary form so as not to damage the potential gems inside,Relevant
Next a gravity based device is used to sort the diamond containing portionscalled the concentratefrom the tailings or the filler rock,Relevant
One of the most commonly used methods to separate the two is a type of washing pan developed in South Africa in the 1870s,Irrelevant
Decomposed kimberlite and waterin a mixture known as a puddleis put into the pan,Relevant
The mixture s viscosity is a crucial element because the lighter particles will rise to the top but the diamonds and other heavy minerals will descend to the bottom of the pan,Irrelevant
Another method of uncovering diamonds uses media separators,Irrelevant
A stew called a slurry is made uptypically consisting of water added to the crushed concentrate and tailings,Relevant
Ferro silicon powder which has a heavy density is also added,Relevant
The slurry may be put into one of three types of media separators,Irrelevant
The first is a cone shaped tank with a cone shaped agitating element inside,Irrelevant
The agitator moves around the sides of the tank but leaves enough room so that the lighter tailings can rise to the top and the heavier elements sink to the bottom,Relevant
In a lifting wheel type of media separator a wheel is filled halfway with slurry,Relevant
Paddles inside it agitate the mixture and lift the heavy particles from the bottom and separate them from the rest of the mixture,Relevant
The third type of media separator is known as a hydrocyclone,Irrelevant
It is a large vat that spins around and through centrifugal force the heavier diamond rich particles are separated,Relevant
After this rudimentary separation the concentrate moves to a greasing area another innovation in diamond manufacturing developed in South Africa in the late 19th century,Relevant
Mixed with water the kimberlite and diamond mixture is placed on a greased belt or table,Relevant
This device is usually slanted and vibrated,Relevant
The method operates on the premise that diamonds newly excavated will not become wet when brought into contact with water,Irrelevant
Instead they will stick to the grease,Irrelevant
Petroleum jelly is usually the preferred substance on the grease belt or table,Irrelevant
The water then carries away the remaining non diamond particles,Relevant
The diamond laden concentrate is then swept off the table and boiled to remove the traces of grease,Relevant
In a newer method X ray technology is used to determine which of the concentrate is diamond and which is effluvial material,Irrelevant
Chunks of diamond eventually become small perfectly shaped gemstones commonly used in engagement rings and other jewelry,Irrelevant
Since diamond is the hardest known substance diamond dust must be used to cut the stone,Irrelevant
In cutting a minuscule groove is incised into the surface of the diamond and a cleaving iron is inserted into the groove,Relevant
With a quick forceful blow the diamond should split perfectly along its naturally occurring planes,Relevant
The lapidary determines further cuts by marking them off on the surface with ink,Relevant
Next a diamond saw oiled with the unusual combination of diamond dust and olive oil is rotated vertically on the surface of the raw gem,Relevant
This device divides the diamond into new segments,Relevant
These parts are then fed into a lathe like device for grinding,Relevant
Fabrication of drywall consists of placing the gypsum core material between two layers of paper drying the product and finishing it into panels of standard size,Relevant
Depending on the variety of wallboard being produced certain additives are blended with the plaster of Paris that will form the core of the drywall,Relevant
Each additional ingredient amounts to less than onehalf of one percent of the amount of gypsum powder,Irrelevant
Starch is added to help the paper facings adhere to the core and paper pulp is added to increase the core s tensile strength resistance to lengthwise pressure ,Relevant
Unexpanded vermiculite is added when producing fire resistant grades of gypsum board in some cases clay is also added,Relevant
Water is added to the plaster of Paris mixture to form a slurry of the proper consistency,Relevant
An asphalt emulsion and or a wax emulsion is added to achieve the desired level of moisture resistance in the final product,Relevant
A foaming agent such as a detergent is included and during the mixing process air is entrained into the material,Relevant
The finished gypsum panel will be over 50% air this minimizes the board s weight and makes it easier to cut fit and nail or screw to the framing,Relevant
Glass fibers are added to the wet core material when making firerated gypsum board,Relevant
The gypsum slurry is poured onto a layer of paper that is unrolling onto a long board machine,Relevant
Another layer of paper unrolls on top of the slurry,Relevant
The sandwich then passes through a system of rollers that compact the gypsum core to the proper thickness,Relevant
The most common thicknesses are 0 37 inch 9 5 mm 0 5 inch 12 7 mm and 0 62 inch 15 7 mm ,Irrelevant
Automated assembly lines in gypsum board plants range from 300 800 feet 93 247 m long,Irrelevant
As the drywall continues along the conveyor belt the edges are formed,Relevant
Various shapes of edges are possible depending on the final use of the panel,Irrelevant
Options include the traditional square edge a tongue and groove type tapered and or beveled edges and even rounded edges,Irrelevant
The face paper is wrapped snugly around each edge and sealed to the back paper,Relevant
By the time the edges have been shaped the plaster core has set sufficiently for a knife to slice the continuous strip into standard panel sizes,Relevant
The board generally 48 inches 1219 mm or 54 inches 1572 mm wide is usually cut into panels that are 8 feet 2400 mm or 12 feet 3600 mm long,Irrelevant
The panels are transferred to a conveyor line that feeds them through a long drying oven,Relevant
At one plant for example the gas fired oven is 470 feet 143 m long,Irrelevant
Panels enter the oven at 500 F 260 C and are exposed to gradually decreasing levels of heat during the 35 40 minutes they travel through the system,Relevant
Humidity and temperature are carefully controlled in the dryer,Relevant
After emerging from the drying oven the dry wall panels are visually inspected before being bundled into lifts of 30 or 40 boards and transferred to the warehouse to await shipment,Relevant
Each board is labeled with a UPC bar code that is used for warehouse inventory billing and price scanning at the retail level,Relevant
The explosive oil is carefully added to a mechanical mixer where it is absorbed by the dope which can be either diatomaceous earth now no longer used wood pulp sawdust flour starch and or other carbonaceous substances and combinations of substances,Relevant
Approximately 1% antacid such as calcium carbonate or zinc oxide is added to neutralize any acidity present in the dope,Relevant
The mixture is monitored carefully and when the correct ingredient level is attained the mixture is ready for packaging into the various forms,Relevant
This process produces what is termed straight dynamite in which the dope does not contribute to the explosive strength of the dynamite,Irrelevant
For example 40% straight dynamite contains 40% nitroglycerin and 60% dope 35% straight dynamite contains 35% nitroglycerin and 65% dope,Irrelevant
In some cases sodium nitrate is mixed with the dope which acts as an oxidizer and gives additional strength to the explosive,Irrelevant
The appearance of dynamite typically resembles a round cartridge approximately 1 25 inches 3 2 cm in diameter and 8 inches 20 cm long,Irrelevant
This type is produced by pressing the dynamite mixture into a paper tube sealed with paraffin,Relevant
The paraffin enclosure protects the dynamite from moisture and being a combustible hydrocarbon contributes to the explosive reaction,Irrelevant
Dynamite can also exist in many other forms from smaller sizes of cartridges for specialized demolition work to large 10 inch 25 cm diameter charges that are used for large strip mining operations,Irrelevant
Regulations limit the length of these big charges to 30 inches 76 cm and the weight to 50 pounds 23 kg ,Irrelevant
Dynamite is also available as a bag powder and in a gelatinized form for underwater use,Irrelevant
The appearance of dynamite typically resembles a round cartridge approximately 1 25 inches in diameter and 8 inches long,Irrelevant
The paraffin enclosure protects the dynomite from moisture and being a combustible hydrocarbon contributes to the explosive reaction,Irrelevant
Dynamites are also made using other substances besides nitroglycerin,Irrelevant
For instance replacing a larger portion of the explosive oil with ammonium nitrate can increase the explosive strength of the dynamite,Irrelevant
This form of dynamite is referred to as ammonia dynamite,Irrelevant
The elevator cars are built at the elevator manufacturer s plant using standard metal cutting welding and forming techniques,Irrelevant
If the cars will be exposed to the weather during building construction the interior trim may be installed after the building is finished,Irrelevant
The rest of the elevator is assembled on the building site,Irrelevant
The building design integrates the elevator shaft from the beginning and the shaft grows as the building is erected,Irrelevant
The walls of the shaft are poured concrete and the shaft straightness and other dimensions are carefully monitored as each floor goes up,Irrelevant
Most elevators use counterweights which equal the weight of the elevator plus 40% of its maximum rated load,Irrelevant
This counterweight reduces the weight the motor must lift and ensures that the elevator cannot fall out of control while the cable is intact,Irrelevant
Guide rails switch ramps service ladders and similar support equipment are bolted into the shaft after the shaft walls are complete but before the shaft is roofed,Relevant
While the shaft is still open at the top a crane raises the counterweight to the top of the building and lowers it into the shaft along its rails,Irrelevant
The crane then lifts the elevator car and inserts it partly into the shaft,Relevant
The guide wheels connect the car to the guide rails and the car is carefully lowered to the bottom of the shaft,Relevant
The shaft is then roofed over leaving a machine room above the shaft,Relevant
The hoist motor governor controller and other equipment are mounted in this room with the motor located directly over the elevator car pulley,Relevant
The elevator and governor cables are strung and attached the electrical connections completed and the controller programmed,Relevant
Water gum and sugar are mixed in a dry blender and then moved to a batch tank,Relevant
Egg whites whey protein concentrate and skim milk proteins are added,Relevant
The pH or acidity levels are adjusted to the mix as it sits in the batch tank,Relevant
Lethecin pectin and citric acid are completely dissolved and dispersed so that no particles larger than 1 micron one millionth of a meter can be found in the premix before homogenizing pasteurization,Relevant
The pectin citric acid mix is then added to the egg white whey and milk proteins,Relevant
The premix a thin pourable liquid is warmed by a heat exchanger to a temperature just below the coagulation region of the protein,Relevant
This is about 165 F 74 C for egg whites,Irrelevant
The warmed mix is poured into the homogenizing pasteurizer and heated another 20 F 6 7 C in less than 10 seconds,Relevant
During this time the mixture is continuously exposed to a uniformly turbulent field of homogenizing force,Irrelevant
Half of the protein denatures as a gel and forms beadlets of about 1 to 3 microns in diameter,Irrelevant
Some times the mixture is poured through a holding tube before it is cooled,Irrelevant
Upon exiting the pasteurizer the mixture is cooled to become creamy smooth opaque and semisolid,Relevant
Simplesse is the end product,Irrelevant
Once the batch is prepared it is fed into a furnace for melting,Relevant
The furnace may be heated by electricity fossil fuel or a combination of the two,Relevant
Temperature must be precisely controlled to maintain a smooth steady flow of glass,Relevant
The molten glass must be kept at a higher temperature about 2500 F [1371 C] than other types of glass in order to be formed into fiber,Relevant
Once the glass becomes molten it is transferred to the forming equipment via a channel forehearth located at the end of the furnace,Relevant
Several different processes are used to form fibers depending on the type of fiber,Irrelevant
Textile fibers may be formed from molten glass directly from the furnace or the molten glass may be fed first to a machine Fiberglassthat forms glass marbles of about 0 62 inch 1 6 cm in diameter,Relevant
These marbles allow the glass to be inspected visually for impurities,Irrelevant
In both the direct melt and marble melt process the glass or glass marbles are fed through electrically heated bushings also called spinnerets ,Relevant
The bushing is made of platinum or metal alloy with anywhere from 200 to 3 000 very fine orifices,Irrelevant
The molten glass passes through the orifices and comes out as fine filaments,Relevant
A long continuous fiber can be produced through the continuous filament process,Relevant
After the glass flows through the holes in the bushing multiple strands are caught up on a high speed winder,Relevant
The winder revolves at about 2 miles 3 km a minute much faster than the rate of flow from the bushings,Irrelevant
The tension pulls out the filaments while still molten forming strands a fraction of the diameter of the openings in the bushing,Relevant
A chemical binder is applied which helps keep the fiber from breaking during later processing,Relevant
The filament is then wound onto tubes,Relevant
It can now be twisted and plied into yarn,Relevant
An alternative method is the staplefiber process,Irrelevant
As the molten glass flows through the bushings jets of air rapidly cool the filaments,Relevant
The turbulent bursts of air also break the filaments into lengths of 8 15 inches 20 38 cm ,Relevant
These filaments fall through a spray of lubricant onto a revolving drum where they form a thin web,Relevant
The web is drawn from the drum and pulled into a continuous strand of loosely assembled fibers,Relevant
This strand can be processed into yarn by the same processes used for wool and cotton,Relevant
Instead of being formed into yarn the continuous or long staple strand may be chopped into short lengths,Relevant
The strand is mounted on a set of bobbins called a creel and pulled through a machine which chops it into short pieces,Relevant
The chopped fiber is formed into mats to which a binder is added,Relevant
After curing in an oven the mat is rolled up,Relevant
Various weights and thicknesses give products for shingles built up roofing or decorative mats,Irrelevant
The rotary or spinner process is used to make glass wool,Irrelevant
In this process molten glass from the furnace flows into a cylindrical container having small holes,Relevant
As the container spins rapidly horizontal streams of glass flow out of the holes,Irrelevant
The molten glass streams are converted into fibers by a downward blast of air hot gas or both,Relevant
The fibers fall onto a conveyor belt where they interlace with each other in a fleecy mass,Relevant
This can be used for insulation or the wool can be sprayed with a binder compressed into the desired thickness and cured in an oven,Irrelevant
The heat sets the binder and the resulting product may be a rigid or semi rigid board or a flexible batt,Relevant
In addition to binders other coatings are required for fiberglass products,Relevant
Lubricants are used to reduce fiber abrasion and are either directly sprayed on the fiber or added into the binder,Relevant
An anti static composition is also sometimes sprayed onto the surface of fiberglass insulation mats during the cooling step,Relevant
Cooling air drawn through the mat causes the anti static agent to penetrate the entire thickness of the mat,Relevant
The anti static agent consists of two ingredientsa material that minimizes the generation of static electricity and a material that serves as a corrosion inhibitor and stabilizer,Irrelevant
Sizing is any coating applied to textile fibers in the forming operation and may contain one or more components lubricants binders or coupling agents ,Irrelevant
Coupling agents are used on strands that will be used for reinforcing plastics to strengthen the bond to the reinforced material,Relevant
Sometimes a finishing operation is required to remove these coatings or to add another coating,Relevant
For plastic reinforcements sizings may be removed with heat or chemicals and a coupling agent applied,Relevant
For decorative applications fabrics must be heat treated to remove sizings and to set the weave,Relevant
Dye base coatings are then applied before dying or printing,Relevant
Fiberglass products come in a wide variety of shapes made using several processes,Irrelevant
For example fiberglass pipe insulation is wound onto rod like forms called mandrels directly from the forming units prior to curing,Irrelevant
The mold forms in lengths of 3 feet 91 cm or less are then cured in an oven,Relevant
The cured lengths are then de molded lengthwise and sawn into specified dimensions,Relevant
Facings are applied if required and the product is packaged for shipment,Relevant
The selection and purchase of the truck chassis is based upon the tactical application of the apparatus,Irrelevant
The truck frame may be bare having only the engine axles springs frame members steering and brake systems installed,Irrelevant
The apparatus builder may choose however to use a cab and chassis where the frame has the engine cab seats front sheet metal and wiring already completed,Irrelevant
In either case the truck frame is usually ordered from a well established truck builder such as General Motors Ford International Freightliner or Peterbilt,Irrelevant
The apparatus builder advises the truck manufacturer of the intended design so special options concerning the performance of the frame can be made,Irrelevant
It is critical that the proper selection of suspension be made to support the average 35 000 pound 15 890 kg fire engine,Irrelevant
In our example we have chosen the cab and chassis frame design,Irrelevant
The basic design of the fire apporatus begins with a thorough review of the fire lood and geographicol terroin of the area the fire department will be responding to,Irrelevant
After the truck frame is received and inspected the fabrication of the body or coach as it is sometimes called begins,Relevant
Primarily sheet steel is used for body panels and supports although aluminum and some stainless steel are also incorporated,Relevant
Sheet steel is approximately 0,Irrelevant
06 inch 1,Irrelevant
5 mm thick and comes in sheets 48 inches 1,Irrelevant
2 m and 96 inches 2,Irrelevant
4 m long,Irrelevant
It can also be supplied in rolls of the same width and weighing 2 000 pounds 908 kg or more,Irrelevant
Each door panel support body panel and equipment tray is cut and bent using shearing machines and press brakes,Relevant
Holes for electrical equipment and piping are also punched at this time,Relevant
The body is typically metal inert gas Mig welded together with the doors and access panels bolted for ease of replacement,Irrelevant
Many manufacturers protect the body from corrosion by dipping each panel into a rust inhibiting sealer,Irrelevant
The interior and other hidden areas of the doors and cabinets are pre painted before assembly,Irrelevant
While the body construction is underway the pump and tank are mounted to the frame,Irrelevant
The pump is selected to perform specifically for the practices of the fire department,Irrelevant
Essentially the pump is the only reason for the fire engine,Irrelevant
All of the other features are practically useless if the pump does not perform adequately,Irrelevant
Most firepumps today are centrifugal pumps and are manufactured by separate companies and purchased by the apparatus builder,Irrelevant
A typical firepump can pump 1 000 gallons 3 785 1 of water per minute,Irrelevant
This flow can safely provide enough water to fight a residential or small commercial building fire,Irrelevant
Pump size can be restricted by the available water supply particularly in rural areas where there are no fire hydrants,Irrelevant
Pumps are usually cast iron with bronze for the rotating impeller and steel gears in the drive unit,Irrelevant
Our truck shall have the 1 000 gallon per minute pump bolted to the frame near the center and driven by an auxiliary output shaft or power take off from the truck transmission,Irrelevant
This type of arrangement is referred to as a midship pump apparatus,Irrelevant
The pump sits across the frame of the truck and is bolted through the support castings to the upper frame flange,Irrelevant
Alignment with the transmission is important to reduce vibration,Irrelevant
The water tank for this example apparatus would typically be a polypropylene tank holding 500 1 000 gallons 1 892 3 785 1 of water,Irrelevant
This is bolted to special Fire Enginesupports before being attached to the frame immediately behind the pump,Irrelevant
Connective piping to the pump and filling openings is also installed typically of galvanized steel construction,Irrelevant
Tanks may be square round or oval and many are hot welded together out of sheet material,Irrelevant
The hot welding process uses a high temperature stream of air to melt the plastic pieces at their joint where the material mixes and fuses together,Irrelevant
Most tanks contain perforated plates or baffles to reduce the sloshing of the water while driving,Irrelevant
Occasionally a quick dump is installed in the tank of an apparatus designed for use in rural locations,Relevant
This large valve dumps the water from the main tank into a folding portable tank carried to the fire on a separate tanker truck,Irrelevant
This allows the tanker trucks to shuttle water from long distances and empty into the portable tank where large suction hoses feeding directly into the pump allow the flow to be increased to maximum capacity,Irrelevant
These quick dump valves empty the 1 500 gallons 5 677 1 of water in 45 seconds,Irrelevant
When the body is completed it is mounted to the frame over the pump and tank and bolted using neoprene or rubber vibration strips,Relevant
Along each side and above the tank are the equipment and hose compartments,Irrelevant
They are formed into the body with doors and covers for protection,Irrelevant
Related equipment such as hose nozzles as well as tactical equipment such as forcible entry tools and self contained breathing units are stored in the side equipment compartments,Irrelevant
They are sized and equipped to allow the fastest and easiest deployment of the equipment,Irrelevant
The hose beds carry the fire hose,Irrelevant
The top bed usually contains 50 foot 15 m long 2,Irrelevant
5 inch 76 cm diameter sections of fire hose connected together to form hoselines reaching up to 1 000 feet 305 m ,Irrelevant
This hose is folded in such a manner as to allow it to be pulled from its bed with ease and speed,Irrelevant
Shorter sections of suction hoses are also carried on the apparatus,Irrelevant
These suction hoses are made of a firm material so they do not collapse from the reduced pressure when coupled to the suction of the pump,Irrelevant
They cannot be folded so they are usually placed into hose troughs specially designed for suction hoses,Irrelevant
All other types of fire hoses are collapsible and for use on the pressure side of the pump only,Irrelevant
After the last accessories and wirings are installed and individually tested the apparatus builder submits the finished truck to an independent inspection agency,Relevant
Upon successful testing the apparatus and the builder are awarded a certificate of performance,Relevant
In front of the tank and above the pump are the attack hoseline beds,Irrelevant
These beds contain 1,Irrelevant
5 inch 3,Irrelevant
8 cm diameter firehoses preconnected to the output of the pump with the nozzles ready for action,Irrelevant
Two or four beds of preconnects are common,Irrelevant
These will be the first hoses used in the incident therefore they are the most important,Irrelevant
Behind the tank is the reel booster,Irrelevant
Here a one inch 2,Irrelevant
5 cm diameter hose on a power roll up reel is stored,Irrelevant
This booster hose is used for cleaning the apparatus and equipment and for cooling the outside of the apparatus when it is near a large fire,Irrelevant
It is also occasionally used to put out small trash or grass fires,Irrelevant
This reel is handy because the hose can be quickly rewound by simply pressing a button,Irrelevant
All other hoses on the fire truck must be washed and packed back into their beds by hand after the fire incident,Irrelevant
Ladders for the fire service are extra heavy duty,Irrelevant
Though made out of aluminum they are physically heavy so they are typically carried in racks above the curb side right side equipment compartments,Irrelevant
Power racks have been developed to lower the ladder to waist height but most commonly the fire fighters simply lift the ladder off of the rack and proceed to the fire,Irrelevant
Ladders like pumps are also purchased from other suppliers and installed by the apparatus builder,Irrelevant
Once the body has been assembled to the truck frame the equipment mounting holes are located and drilled and any additional holes or passages are cut into the panels,Relevant
This allows the painting operation to seal the exposed edges of holes and other openings,Relevant
The exterior of the apparatus is washed and sanded in preparation for painting,Relevant
The interior of the doors and compartments have already been painted,Relevant
The out side can be painted in matching colors,Relevant
The painting process includes a primer surfacer to fill small sanding marks and surface defects and a sealer to improve paint adhesion,Irrelevant
Fire trucks used to be all red but some experiments with yellow blue and white have been done to increase visual identification,Irrelevant
Today the NFPA recommends yellow or the standard Fire Engine Red,Irrelevant
The type of paint is usually a tough enamel or synthetic to resist burning embers and wear from fire service,Irrelevant
Hardening agents are added to the paint to improve the shine and durability,Relevant
After painting the ladders and accessories can be installed using stainless steel fasteners,Relevant
The modern fire apparatus can be complicated,Irrelevant
Radio systems cellular phones computers and cellular fax machines are all finding their way into the fire service,Irrelevant
Even our example apparatus will require several hundred feet of wiring to operate the warning lights siren radios bay lights generator flood lights pump electricals and other systems,Irrelevant
Most apparatuses have two independent battery systems which must be wired into the apparatus after painting,Irrelevant
The pump operator s control panel containing the pressure gauges and valves used to control the pump will also be installed,Relevant
The ingredients used to prepare stars are obtained from chemical supply companies and stored in barrels,Relevant
At the time of mixing the chemicals are scooped out of the barrels weighed and sifted twice through brass screens to remove lumps,Relevant
Brass is used because it does not produce sparks ,Irrelevant
The sifted powders are placed on a large sheet of paper and gently mixed by hand,Relevant
The powders may also be mixed inside a rotating drum or a stationary container with rotating paddles,Relevant
These devices must be used with great care to avoid generating heat through friction or trapping bits of powder between moving parts,Irrelevant
The mixed powder is placed in barrels and taken from the mixing room to the cutting room,Relevant
Water is mixed with it to form a soft dough,Relevant
Lumps of the dough are scooped into large paper lined wooden molds shaped like loaves of bread,Relevant
The dough is packed firmly into the mold with a wooden mallet,Relevant
The wet dough is much safer to manipulate than the dry powder ,Irrelevant
The loaves of dough weighing about 35 pounds 16 kg each are unmolded onto a workbench covered with heavy cardboard sprinkled with black powder,Irrelevant
The loaves are cut in one direction to form slices then cut in the other direction to form dice,Relevant
The dimensions of the dice may be anywhere from 0 06 2 inches 0 16 5 cm ,Irrelevant
The black powder adheres to the wet dice and will help them burn when the firework is ignited,Irrelevant
The dice are allowed to dry on papercovered screens,Relevant
The dried dice are now stars,Relevant
They are moved to the packing room to be placed into cardboard containers,Relevant
A hollow cardboard tube is placed in the center of the cylindrical container and stars are gently poured around it,Relevant
A large container may hold as many as 900 stars about 4 4 pounds [2 kg] ,Irrelevant
When the container is full black powder is poured inside the hollow tube and the tube is removed,Relevant
The powder fills the spaces between the stars and will serve to ignite and scatter them,Relevant
A paper cap is placed on the filled container now called a break,Relevant
The break is wrapped with heavy string a process known as spiking,Relevant
Spiking is done by tying one end of a large spool of string to the break and winding the string around it,Relevant
When the break is completely covered the string is cut and tied,Relevant
Some breaks are not spiked but are made instead of plastic or heavier cardboard to withstand the stress of being launched,Relevant
A time fuse a short slow burning fuse that causes the break to explode a certain amount of time after it is launched is inserted into the break and it is wrapped in heavy paper,Relevant
The wrapped breaks are moved to the pasting room to be wrapped in heavy paste soaked paper then allowed to dry for about two days,Relevant
The paper hardens as the paste dries to form a strong tight seal,Irrelevant
Some breaks known as salutes are filled with flash powder rather than stars and black powder,Relevant
Flash powder is mixed in much the same way as the chemicals used to make stars,Relevant
It is then poured into cardboard containers that are thicker and stronger than other breaks,Irrelevant
This allows more pressure to build up before the salute bursts resulting in a louder bang,Irrelevant
These salutes are then spiked and pasted like other breaks,Relevant
The dry breaks are moved to the finishing room to be assembled into shells,Relevant
The simplest shells consist of a small compartment of black powder combined with a single break,Irrelevant
Due to their spherical structure Asian shells always contain only one break,Irrelevant
Because American and European shells are cylindrical more than one break can be stacked together so that the shell will display multiple bursts of different colors when it explodes,Irrelevant
Multi break shells usually consist of a small compartment of black powder three or four colored breaks and a salute,Irrelevant
Some large shells contain as many as 10 breaks and at least one gigantic shell has been made holding 22 breaks,Irrelevant
The shell is assembled by stacking the components together attaching a starting fuse a long fast burning fuse used to ignite the black powder that launches the firework wrapping them in heavy paper and tying the package together with string,Relevant
The completed firework is then labeled and stored until needed,Relevant
Small fireworks intended for private use are made in much the same way as large ones but they are generally simpler in construction and contain much less explosive,Irrelevant
Small fireworks include firecrackers paper tubes holding a small amount of explosive fountains paper cones filled with chemicals which release colored sparks and Roman candles long paper tubes filled with a small amount of explosive and several small stars which shoot out one at a time ,Irrelevant
Some small fireworks contain no explosive at all and may be as simple as a single chemical wrapped in paper or foil,Irrelevant
Examples include smoke balls filled with a chemical that releases colored smoke and snakes filled with ammonium dichromate which slowly burns and produces a long trail of ash ,Irrelevant
Sparklers are made by dipping a metal wire in a slurry containing a fuel an oxidizer a coloring agent and aluminum granules which provide the sparks,Irrelevant
Professional fireworks are usually launched by the same companies who make them,Irrelevant
If a set piece a ground based display that forms a picture or words with colored flares called lances is to be used the design to be formed is sketched on graph paper and sent to carpenters who build a wooden frame with thin wooden slats in the shape of the design,Irrelevant
If music will accompany the fireworks the timing of the display is planned to match the tempo of the music,Irrelevant
Several hours before the show begins or a few days in advance for a very large show the crew arrives with all the necessary equipment including fire extinguishers and first aid kits,Irrelevant
Mortars to launch the shells are placed in their proper places,Relevant
Large ones are placed in holes dug in the ground or in steel drums filled with sand,Relevant
Smaller mortars are placed in wooden racks,Relevant
The proper shell for each mortar is loaded in place,Relevant
The frames for set pieces are assembled lances are attached to the slats and fuses are attached to the lances,Relevant
When the display begins the lances and mortars are lit at the proper times either with long hand held flares or with electrical wires attached to a central switchboard,Relevant
After the show the crew safely destroys any unexploded duds,Relevant
The ingredients for fortune cookies are mixed together to form the batter,Relevant
This watery dough is transferred by a pump to the fortune cookie oven which is circular and contains a number of shallow cups with flat bottoms about 3 inches [7 6 cm] in diameter in the shape of the finished but unfolded cookie,Relevant
When the cups are filled with the correct amount of dough as regulated by the batter pump flat metal plates are placed in the cups on top of the dough,Relevant
The plates flatten the dough and also allow heat to transfer through the metal surfaces against both the top and bottom of the cookie so it is golden brown on both sides,Relevant
The cookies rotate through the circular oven,Relevant
One complete orbit takes 3 5 minutes which is the time it takes the thin dough to bake,Irrelevant
In a variation of this method the dough is poured on a griddle and the round shapes are stamped out by metal forms,Relevant
When the cookie has finished baking it sticks to the plate,Relevant
As the plates are lifted up a mechanical arm snatches the cookie from the plate and transfers it to a receiving area where the fortunes are added,Relevant
The paper strips are sucked by vacuum onto the cookies,Relevant
The cookies are pushed along to two mechanical fingers that grab the still hot cookie and fold it in half so it resembles a half moon with the paper fortune inside,Relevant
The machine then bends the cookie in the middle to its familiar crescent shape which has been fancifully described as a pair of water wings a fan or an extracted molar  The formed cookie is then cooled by air from a fan and pushed to the packaging area,Relevant
Cookies are packed in small bags for store sale or large bags for restaurant use and the bags are placed in cartons to protect their fragile cargo,Relevant
A freeze drying processing facility is usually a large plant with modern equipment,Irrelevant
Its food handling areas must be approved by the United States Department of Agriculture and the company and its employees must adhere to government regulatory procedures,Irrelevant
The plant may include a receiving and storage area for raw foods that arrive at the plant in bulk a food cooking area for those foods that must be cooked before processing a large area with several large freezing and drying chambers and a packaging area,Irrelevant
The facility may also include a research area where improved methods of freeze drying foods are developed and a test kitchen where new preparation techniques to improve the final taste quality and texture of the food are tried,Irrelevant
Some plants are dedicated to freeze drying only one product like freeze dried coffee,Irrelevant
Others process a wide range of meats vegetables and fruits,Irrelevant
Nonfood products such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals are usually processed in separate plants from food products,Irrelevant
The freeze drying process varies in the details of temperatures times pressures and intermediate steps from one food to another,Irrelevant
The following is a generalized description of the process with several specific exceptions noted,Irrelevant
The food is first checked for contamination and purity,Relevant
Fruits meats and some other edibles are tested for bacterial counts and spoilage,Relevant
Much of the work of the plant is dependent on the harvest season for each food,Irrelevant
In January for example the plant would be processing celery olives lemons oranges and pineapples,Irrelevant
In July it would process green beans peas and strawberries among others,Irrelevant
Some kinds of food like seafood and meats must be cooked before freeze drying,Relevant
They are usually purchased already cut into small pieces,Relevant
If they have not been pre cooked and frozen these foods are placed in large industrial sized kettles and properly cooked,Relevant
Fruits and vegetables are usually purchased already cut pitted and peeled,Relevant
These foods are simply washed with sprays of water,Relevant
Some vegetables like peas and corn are quickly scalded or blanched before freezing,Irrelevant
Coffee is purchased as a pre brewed concentrated liquid,Relevant
Because the aroma of coffee is important to consumers a small amount of coffee bean oil may be added to the liquid,Relevant
Unlike the water the oil is not removed during the drying process,Relevant
The food pieces are spread out on flat metal trays which are stacked 20 to 30 high in slots in a wheeled cart,Irrelevant
With food that has been pre cooked and frozen the trays are pre chilled to prevent partial thawing during handling,Relevant
With liquids like coffee the pre brewed coffee is poured into shallow pans,Relevant
The carts are wheeled into a large walk in coldroom where the temperature can be as low as 40 F 40 C ,Relevant
In this extremely cold temperature the food is quickly frozen,Relevant
There are usually a dozen or more coldrooms in operation and the carts are kept there until it is time to move them into the drying chamber,Irrelevant
The carts are wheeled out of the coldroom and into a vacuum drying chamber,Relevant
In the case of liquids like coffee the frozen coffee is first ground up into small particles in a low temperature grinder,Relevant
The drying chamber is a large long horizontal cylinder with semi elliptical ends,Irrelevant
One end is hinged to open and close,Relevant
When the trays of frozen food pieces are inside the chamber is closed and sealed,Relevant
In a large plant there may be 20 to 30 drying chambers in operation at any time,Irrelevant
The drying procedure involves a process known as sublimation,Irrelevant
In sublimation a solid material is forced to change state into a gaseous material without ever becoming a liquid,Irrelevant
In the case of freezedried food the solid ice crystals trapped in the frozen food pieces are forced to change into water vapor without ever becoming liquid water,Irrelevant
In the drying chamber this is accomplished by evacuating the air with a vacuum pump to reduce the pressure to about 0 036 psi 0 0025 bar ,Irrelevant
The temperature of the food is raised to about 100 F 38 C by direct conduction through the bottom of the trays radiation from heat lamps or microwave heating,Relevant
When the chamber is evacuated of air the pressure is below the threshold at which water can simultaneously exist in a solid liquid and gaseous vapor state,Irrelevant
This threshold is known as the triple point of water,Irrelevant
Once the pressure falls below this point the heat causes the ice crystals trapped in the frozen pieces of food to change directly to water vapor,Irrelevant
The vapor is drawn off and condensed within the chamber leaving the food behind,Relevant
The dried food is filled with tiny voids like a sponge where the ice crystals were once present,Relevant
Not only does this make it easier for the food to reabsorb water when it is prepared for consumption but the dried food retains its original size and shape,Irrelevant
The time for this drying process varies,Irrelevant
Freeze dried liquids make take only about four hours to prepare while semi solids and solids like soup and sliced meats may take 12 hours or more,Irrelevant
The dried food pieces are removed from the drying chamber and tested for moisture content and purity,Relevant
Some food pieces may be ground to a smaller size or may be reduced to a powder,Relevant
Others may be screened to separate them by size,Relevant
Two or more different products may also be blended together to meet a customer s specific specifications,Relevant
Freeze dried foods must be sealed in airtight containers to prevent them from absorbing moisture from the air,Relevant
Several types of containers may be used plastic laminated foil pouches metal and plastic cans or metal and fiber drums for bulk packaging,Irrelevant
Some freeze dried food is vacuum packed in which the air is evacuated from the container before sealing,Relevant
Other food has an inert gas like nitrogen injected into the container before sealing to displace the oxygen in the air and prevent oxidation or spoiling of the food,Relevant
The packaging is done in the freeze dry plant almost as soon as the foods come out of the drying chamber,Relevant
The plant can form fill and seal the packages to the desired weight for the end user,Irrelevant
Packages that are to be sold directly to the consumer are packed in cartons stacked on pallets and transported to the grocery warehouse,Relevant
Other freeze dried food is packaged in bulk and sold to a secondary processor for incorporation into other food products,Relevant
Freeze dried blueberries for example may be sent to a company that makes pancake and muffin mixes,Irrelevant
The ingredients are selected for freshness and quality,Irrelevant
They are measured in precise quantities according to the particular recipe,Relevant
Liquid and dry ingredients are combined separately,Relevant
The liquids are poured into a vat mixed together and heated,Relevant
Next the dry ingredients are added to the liquids in a particular order,Relevant
Meanwhile the batch is stiffed and the temperature gradually increased,Relevant
Most ingredients must be incorporated before the mix is heated to 120 F 49 C so that the mix does not become lumpy,Relevant
The mixture must be heated to dissolve and blend the ingredients,Relevant
Pasteurizing the batch is necessary to destroy pathogenic bacteria and to help preserve the finished product,Relevant
It is also required by law in most regions,Irrelevant
Pasteurization is a simple process that involves quickly bringing the mix to a high temperature for a specified time and then quickly reducing the temperature to less than 40 F 4 C ,Irrelevant
The trend in the industry has been toward increasing the pasteurization temperature to about 175 F 79 C for about 25 40 seconds,Irrelevant
For greater results batches can be pasteurized at temperatures as high as 210 F 99 C to 220 F 104 C ,Relevant
These high temperatures also improve the flavor and help blend the ingredients more effectively,Irrelevant
Homogenizing the batch makes it smoother primarily by decreasing the size of fat globules to less than two micrometers,Irrelevant
Without homogenization fat could rise to the top of the mixture and create a layer of cream,Irrelevant
Homogenization consists of pumping the batch through a small valve and against an impact ring,Relevant
Three forces are at work,Irrelevant
As the mix passes at a high velocity of about 30 000 fpm feet per minute through the valve shear forces begin to break up the fat particles,Relevant
The impact ring ruptures the fat further,Irrelevant
Completing the process is cavitation in which vapor bubbles are created by a sudden discharge of pressure,Irrelevant
Within the bubbles the fat droplets crash against the vapor walls and disintegrate thus the more fat the more homogenization required,Irrelevant
While the temperature of the mix is 90 F 32 C it is inoculated with 1% yogurt culture,Irrelevant
The mix remains at this temperature until it sets and is ready for cooling,Irrelevant
After homogenization the mixture must be cooled,Relevant
If it is cooled slowly from about 90 F 32 C to about 40 F 4 C the mix will become more viscous,Irrelevant
Once the temperature falls between 32 F 0 C and 40 F 4 C the batch is stored in aging tanks inside coolers,Relevant
The mix is aged for up to four hours,Relevant
The final ingredients are mixed together in a flavor vat,Relevant
These include sweeteners flavorings and coloring,Irrelevant
This mixture is then pumped into the freezer with the rest of the mixture which is about 20 F 6 C to 28 F 2 C ,Relevant
While the mix is hardening it is agitated to incorporate air and create over run or excess volume,Relevant
The addition of air also smoothes the consistency and creates a more palatable product,Relevant
In about three minutes the mix begins to freeze and within a few more minutes the desired overrun about 50% is achieved,Relevant
About one to two thirds of the water freezes during this stage,Relevant
After the desired overrun is reached the mixture is packaged and placed in freezers where the freezing process continues,Relevant
The temperature falls quickly within one or two minutes to at least 0 F 17 C but ideally 15 F 26 C ,Irrelevant
For best results the freezing process should occur rapidly so that the mixture does not form large coarse ice crystals but small smooth ones,Irrelevant
The frozen yogurt may be stored in continuous or batch freezers,Irrelevant
In the former there is a constant flow of product into the freezer while in the batch method batches are prepared individually,Irrelevant
Depending on the type of freezer and the size and shape of the package the final hardening takes between 30 minutes to 12 hours,Irrelevant
The containers of frozen yogurt are piled closely together inside the delivery trucks to minimize the temperature change during shipping,Relevant
The vehicles are generally mechanically refrigerated at the same temperatures as in the storage facilities in the factory about 15 F 26 C and not above the temperature at the retail outlet,Irrelevant
Dry ice may be used as a refrigerant though it risks heat shock to the yogurt which occurs if the temperature falls too low the freezing point for dry ice is 109 F 78 C ,Irrelevant
The frozen yogurt is shipped to retail outlets and food service establishments or to other manufacturers for further processing into novelties,Relevant
The first step in the manufacture of gasoline is to find its parent ingredient petroleum,Relevant
Crude oil is trapped in areas of porous rock or reservoir rock after it has migrated there from the area of its origin,Relevant
Possible areas of oil concentration may be pinpointed by looking for rock types that are commonly found in those areas,Irrelevant
Explorers may examine the surface features of the land analyze how sound waves bounce off the rock or use a gravity meter to detect slight differences in rock formations,Relevant
Gasoline is a volatile flammable liquid obtained from the refinement of petroleum or crude oil,Irrelevant
After a possible oil reservoir is found the area must be test drilled,Relevant
Core samples are taken from test wells to confirm rock formations and the samples are chemically analyzed in order to determine if more drilling is justified,Relevant
Although the methods used today are more advanced than any of the past there is still no certainty in oil exploration,Irrelevant
Crude oil is recovered through wells that can reach over 1 000 feet 305 m into the rock,Relevant
The holes are made by rotary drillers which use a bit to bore a hole in the ground as water is added,Relevant
The water and soil create a thick mud that helps hold back the oil and prevent it from gushing due to the internal pressure contained in the reservoir rock,Relevant
When the reservoir is reached the mud continues to hold back the oil while the drill is removed and a pipe is inserted,Relevant
To recover the oil a complicated system of pipes and valving is installed directly into the drilling well,Relevant
The natural pressure of the reservoir rock brings the oil out of the well and into the pipes,Relevant
These are connected to a recovery system which consists of a series of larger pipes taking the crude oil to the refinery via an oil liquid and gas non liquid separator,Relevant
This method allows the oil to be recovered with a minimum of waste,Irrelevant
Eventually the natural pressure of the well is expended though great quantities of oil may still remain in the rock,Relevant
Secondary recovery methods are now required to obtain a greater percentage of the oil,Relevant
The pressure is restored by either injecting gas into the pocket above the oil or by flooding water into the well which is far more common,Relevant
In this process four holes are drilled around the perimeter of the well and water is added,Relevant
The petroleum will float on the water and come to the surface,Relevant
Crude oil is not a good fuel since it is not fluid and requires a very high temperature to burn,Irrelevant
The long chains of molecules in crude oil must be separated from the smaller chains of refined fuels including gasoline in a petroleum refinery,Irrelevant
This process is called fractional distillation,Irrelevant
A fractional distillation tower is a huge unit that may hold up to 200 000 barrels of crude oil,Irrelevant
The oil is first pumped into a furnace and heated to over 600 F 316 C causing all but the largest molecules to evaporate,Relevant
The vapors rise into the fractionating column which may be as tall as 150 feet 46 m ,Relevant
The vapors cool as they rise through the column,Relevant
Since the boiling points of all the compounds differ the larger heavier molecules will condense first lower in the tower and the shorter lighter molecules will condense higher in the tower,Irrelevant
Natural gases gasoline and kerosene are released near the top,Relevant
Heavier compounds used in the manufacture of plastics and lubricants are removed lower in the tower,Irrelevant
Fractional distillation itself does not produce gasoline from crude oil it just removes the gasoline from other compounds in crude oil,Irrelevant
Further refining processes are now used to improve the quality of the fuel,Relevant
Catalytic cracking is one of the most important processes in oil refining,Irrelevant
This process uses a catalyst high temperature and increased pressure to affect chemical changes in petroleum,Irrelevant
Catalysts such as aluminum platinum processed clay and acids are added to petroleum to break down larger molecules so that it will possess the desired compounds of gasoline,Relevant
Another refining process is polymerization,Irrelevant
This is the opposite of cracking in that it combines the smaller molecules of lighter gases into larger ones that can be used as liquid fuels,Irrelevant
Once gasoline is refined chemicals are added,Relevant
Some are anti knock compounds which react with the chemicals in gasoline that burn too quickly to prevent engine knock,Irrelevant
In leaded gasoline tetraethyl lead is the anti knock additive,Irrelevant
Unleaded gasoline is refined further so the need for anti knock additives is minimal ,Irrelevant
Other additives antioxidants are added to prevent the formation of gum in the engine,Relevant
Gum is a resin formed in gasoline that can coat the internal parts of the engine and increase wear,Irrelevant
Gasoline is primarily a mixture of two volatile liquids heptane and isooctane,Irrelevant
Pure heptane a lighter fuel burns so quickly that it produces a great amount of knocking in an engine,Irrelevant
Pure isooctane evaporates slowly and produces virtually no knocking,Irrelevant
The ratio of heptane to isooctane is measured by the octane rating,Relevant
The greater the percentage of isooctane the less knocking and the higher the octane rating,Irrelevant
For example an octane rating of 87 is comparable to a mixture of 87% isooctane and 13% heptane,Irrelevant
The outer skin covers and shields of the baler are punched or blanked out of sheet steel in a large punch press or by laser cutter,Relevant
The sheet metal can be taken directly from the roll or precut into flat sheets as needed,Irrelevant
Punch presses operate by forcing a hardened steel punch through the material into a hardened die with up to 200 tons of force,Relevant
This shears the metal to size and the rapid stroke of the punch press allows many parts to be produced per hour,Relevant
More intricate shapes and low volume parts are cut using an industrial laser to burn through the metal in a preprogrammed pattern,Relevant
In spite of being slower than the punch press the laser reduces material waste by arranging the part shapes to most effectively utilize the sheet size,Relevant
Another advantage of the laser cutter is that it requires practically no set up which means it can create different sized parts without physically adapting the machine,Irrelevant
This is important as one machine can then produce hundreds of different parts in any random order and provide them to the rest of the manufacturing process as needed,Irrelevant
Balers are constructed primarily of structural and sheet steel,Irrelevant
This steel can be in bar stock sheets or in rolls,Irrelevant
Hydraulic cylinders pumps wheels and tires belts and other components are purchased from suppliers and shipped to the baler assembly plant,Irrelevant
Bar stock steel that is used for frames shafts arms and other structural parts is cut using a band saw,Irrelevant
These saws have many toothed cutting blades driven over two large wheels,Irrelevant
The wheels rotate and move the blade continuously to cut through the bar,Irrelevant
Bar stock can be round square rectangular solid or hollow plus many other shapes specific to the desired application,Irrelevant
After cutting to length holes and slots are drilled punched or milled into the parts as needed,Relevant
Structural parts are usually fabricated close to the welding area to minimize time between operations,Irrelevant
Welding is performed primarily by robotic welders,Irrelevant
These machines are operated by a computer that has been programmed to move the welding electrode wire through a specific range of motion,Irrelevant
The robotic welder is very accurate and makes high quality repeatable welds,Irrelevant
After the various components are clamped into a large welding fixture by the operator the robot extends a short piece of welding wire from the welding gun,Relevant
With the welding current turned off it gently touches a computer sensor that accurately defines the exact position of the wire tip,Relevant
Then the robot touches the tip of the wire to each of the components in two or three places,Relevant
All of this touching is actually transmitting data to the computer about the exact location of the components in reference to the desired location of the weld,Relevant
Once complete the computer program compensates slightly for any deviation from the exact position,Relevant
The welding current is turned on and the wire is fed into the arc while the robot moves the gun along the joint,Relevant
This insures that the welds will be exactly at the proper place and achieve the highest possible strength,Relevant
It also prevents welding any misplaced or incorrect parts reducing scrap and possible machine failures,Relevant
In many critical applications robotic welders can be more accurate than a human welder because of this type of programming,Irrelevant
After welding fabricated parts as well as shields and covers are cleaned and painted,Relevant
Cleaning is accomplished by hot steam or solvents inside an enclosure,Relevant
The paint is applied by dipping the parts into an electrostatic paint tank,Relevant
These tanks are large enough to submerge an entire baler frame typically 15 feet 4 5 m long and 10 feet 3 m wide,Irrelevant
They contain 20 000 40 000 gallons 75 700 151 400 1 of paint,Irrelevant
The paint is suspended in a water solution and charged with a negative electric charge,Relevant
The parts are charged positive and when the parts submerge into the solution the electrical attraction of the two charges sticks the paint tightly to the metal,Relevant
The parts are hoisted out of the tank and allowed to drip before they are placed into a drying oven,Relevant
This drying oven heats the parts to approximately 365 F 185 C which bakes the paint into a hard finish,Irrelevant
Because balers are used and sometimes stored outside a good finish is needed to protect the steel from rusting,Irrelevant
The hay enters the baler through the pickup,Relevant
Directly behind the pickup is the compressor bar which holds the hay in place so the auger can feed it into the bale chamber,Irrelevant
The bale chamber contains a plunger that drive in and out each time packing and compressing hay into the desired shape,Irrelevant
After painting the frame of the baler is placed onto a wheeled cart,Relevant
This allows the baler to be moved and assembled at a variety of work stations each adding specific components and performing quality checks during production,Irrelevant
The hydraulics pickup tines bale tensioners knotters and subassemblies are bolted into place,Relevant
Many design features create special hole patterns tabs pins notches and other forms to prevent the parts from being assembled in the wrong place or position,Relevant
After assembly the hydraulic systems are filled with oil belt and chain tensions are adjusted and the bearings greased,Relevant
The baler then has the tire and wheel assemblies mounted and identifying decals and stickers attached,Relevant
Since a baler can be a very dangerous machine many warning labels are applied to caution operators to keep their hands away from the moving parts,Relevant
Finished balers are finally inspected and operated without hay to check the functionality of all the parts,Relevant
Most are shipped by truck or railcar to dealers all over the world,Relevant
A technician may be sent out to the field with the new baler to instruct the operator and make final adjustments,Relevant
Often changes in the hay crop will require occasional adjustment to the baler to produce quality bales,Relevant
Before fabrication begins the user is screened by a trained professional,Irrelevant
The screening includes a hearing test and the results are used to create an audiogram covering a variety of parameters,Irrelevant
At the screening stage an impression or mold of the user s outer ear is also taken,Relevant
The audiogram and the impression are integral to the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
All order datadesired product features and the results of the audiogramare entered in a computer to determine the operating range for the hearing aid specifically which levels of amplification are required for the user,Irrelevant
For some manufacturers the computer also selects the electronic circuitry to be used,Relevant
Typically an order card will be prepared and sent to the production line along with the ear impression,Relevant
A parts card is also printed and sent to the stock room where the various components are stored,Relevant
In this step a form or reverse copy of the impression of the outer ear and ear canal is produced,Relevant
A sheet of clear vinyl is placed over the impression then heat is applied,Relevant
When cooled the impression is removed from the vinyl form and trimmed,Relevant
Next the impression is dipped in hot wax giving it a smooth paper thin coating for the casting step,Relevant
Here a technician will place the impression on a metal plate and place rings around it,Relevant
A clear liquid colloid or particle suspension is poured into the rings immersing the impression,Relevant
The liquid is allowed to cure into a rubbery silicone consistency,Relevant
Lastly the impression is pulled out of the gel,Relevant
The shell or outer casing of the hearing aid is made from this mold,Relevant
The mold is first heated in 110 F 43 C water and air is blown through it to clear away any impurities,Relevant
At this point a technician will mix liquid acrylic of equal parts monomer and polymer for a structurally sound shell and add the desired pigment to give the shell a pink tan or brown color,Relevant
The technician pours the liquid into the heated colloid mold and after ten seconds pours off any excess leaving a thin acrylic shell inside the mold,Relevant
After 10 minutes of cooling the technician pulls from the mold a shell that is a perfect replica of the raw impression of the ear canal,Relevant
After a technician grinds off the excess flanges from the shell he will add a vent or opening,Relevant
A small piece of silicon wire shaped to the vent size is run through the inside of the shell and pulled out,Relevant
The technician drills holes into the canal end of the shell for the receiver tube,Relevant
After that the outside of the shell will be buffed to a smooth shiny finish,Relevant
A technician will size the shell for a face plate or flangethe area that will be exposed outside the ear canalusing the vacuum form from the original impression,Relevant
The plate will be carefully set at the correct angle for the user s ear,Relevant
The components and circuits are run on a ceramic substrate base of various designs,Relevant
The substrate is made by a screen printing technique that alternates layers of conductive and insulating materials depending on the engineered design,Irrelevant
The conducting layer contains gold and silver and the insulating layers contain silicon compounds,Irrelevant
Between the printing of each layer the substrate is passed by a conveyor through a furnace where it bakes for two hours at 850 F 454 C ,Relevant
This seals the layers and creates the color patterns characteristic of printed circuit boards only on a smaller scale,Relevant
The various electronic components are bonded by hand to the gold and silver parts on both sides of the substrate,Relevant
A technician will interconnect the devices using gold wire of 001 inch 025 mm thickness,Relevant
Lastly the components are sealed in an epoxy paste and heat hardened,Relevant
Working from the parts card or bill of materials determined at the outset of production a technician assembles the electronic hardware on the face plate where holes have been drilled for mounting the microphone amplifier battery compartment and volume control all hand wired with colors for traceability,Irrelevant
The wires are soldered into place,Relevant
After this the receiver is mounted into the shell and a preliminary hearing check made on the instrument,Relevant
In the final production steps the parts are carefully packaged to avoid interferences,Relevant
A plastic cement is brushed on while the technician performs a listening check to make sure there is no oscillation in the sound quality,Relevant
Once the cement dries excess face plate is cut away and the remaining edge ground off with a hand lathe,Relevant
Finally the aid is buffed and shined to a high gloss and manufacturing is complete,Relevant
The aid is now ready for final testing,Relevant
The blade begins as a blank cut from flat material that is in a soft condition which means it has not been heat treated,Relevant
Mass produced knives are stamped in a punch press using a hardened punch and die shaped to match the outline of the blade,Relevant
The punch is forced through the material into the die blanking the rough blade into shape,Relevant
Custom knives may be cut out with a saw or an industrial laser may be used to cut especially intricate blades,Relevant
The most important part of the modern hunting knife the blade is made of steel or stainless steel,Irrelevant
Of particular importance is the carbon content of the metal which determines the hardness of the blade,Irrelevant
After the blank is cut holes for the handle stocks are drilled into the tang,Relevant
Rough shaping is also performed by grinding or machining,Relevant
This shaping forms the thickness of the blade at various points and reduces the amount of finish grinding on the sharp edge,Relevant
Any identifying markings or decorative details are stamped while the blade is in a soft condition,Relevant
The blade is hardened to preserve the sharpness of the knife edge,Relevant
Each blade material may require different hardening and heat treating methods however common steel blades are generally heat treated in the following manner,Irrelevant
To harden the blade several blades are placed into a ceramic tray in a heat treating oven,Relevant
They are laid flat so the weight of the blades does not cause warping,Relevant
Depending upon the specific requirements of the alloy the temperature in the oven is raised to approximately 1600 F 871 C ,Irrelevant
After heating the blades for approximately two hours the entire tray is removed from the oven and the blades are submerged in oil or water,Relevant
This rapidly cools the blades and is called quenching,Irrelevant
The quenching locks the metal crystals into an intricate microscopic pattern,Relevant
This process also results in the metal becoming very brittle,Irrelevant
After quenching the blades are reheated to approximately 500 F 260 C ,Relevant
At this point the metal has a slight dark reddish color and the crystals change their alignment slightly,Irrelevant
Then the blades are allowed to cool slowly in a process called tempering,Irrelevant
This toughens the metal while retaining some of the brittleness needed for fine sharpening,Irrelevant
Further heating and cooling cycles may be used to harden other specialized alloys,Relevant
After the heat treated blades are cool they are polished and sharpened,Relevant
Polishing is performed by machine or by hand,Relevant
A flat belt sander is used to produce a smooth even brushed finish to the sides of the blade,Relevant
This also polishes out any marks from the punch press operation and removes the surface residue from the heat treat operation,Relevant
Next the blade is placed into a grinding fixture that passes it through a series of grinding wheels,Relevant
Each rotating wheel removes the correct amount of metal to form the edge relief point rough edge angle and other features of the working portion of the blade,Irrelevant
When utility knives are made many of these features are left without further finishing since they are for functional rather than cosmetic purposes,Relevant
In the case of fancier knives these features may be hand polished using a rotating buffing wheel and jeweler s rouge,Irrelevant
The rouge is a soft abrasive paste which when spread onto the cotton buffing wheel and then buffed against the blade surface polishes the metal to a high luster,Irrelevant
When the blade is finished with these steps it will be quite sharp and may appear ready to use,Relevant
However the final sharpening steps are required to produce a long lasting edge,Relevant
To the casual observer the knife edge appears as simply the result of two intersecting surfaces,Relevant
Upon closer examination the true form of the edge is seen to consist of two distinctly separate sets of angles,Irrelevant
The first is left by the rough grinding as explained above while the second is the fine angle that actually forms the cutting edge,Relevant
This edge is produced by a fine grinding operation called honing,Irrelevant
The angle of the hone may be between 17 and 30 degrees to the axis of the blade depending upon the blade application,Irrelevant
A smaller angle will produce a sharper edge but the edge will wear and become dull more quickly,Irrelevant
A fine grinding hone or stone is oiled and gently rubbed on the knife edge,Relevant
This action produces the finest sharpened edge and is the only true method of properly sharpening a knife blade,Relevant
When viewed under a microscope the rough ground edge appears as a series of jagged points,Irrelevant
While sharp enough to cut adequately in this condition the points wear easily and soon the sharpness is gone,Irrelevant
By honing these points are blended into a consistent edge of equal sharpness,Relevant
The stocks are riveted or pressed onto the tang of the knife blade,Relevant
A buffing wheel is used to smooth the stocks and blend the rivet heads,Relevant
In the case of a leather handle the washer segments are stacked onto the tang starting at the guard,Relevant
After the handle length is filled with leather the pommel is pressed onto the end of the tang and secured with a pin or rivet,Relevant
This squeezes the leather together making a tight easily gripped handle,Relevant
The leather may be shaped using a grinding wheel and then sealed with a penetrating sealer,Relevant
The guard and pommel can then be finished by polishing with the buffing wheel,Relevant
Great care must be taken during the assembly and finishing process as not to damage the knife blade or ruin the sharp edge,Relevant
The leather or nylon is fed into a cutting machine that stamps out eight standardized pieces four for the boot lining and four for the boot upper,Irrelevant
A similar machine cuts pieces for the tongue sole heel and reinforcement sections,Relevant
The pieces are mechanically punched with a date code size order number and eyelet holes,Relevant
The boot is sewn together on industrial sewing machines that the plant workers regulate with foot pedals or control panels,Relevant
The lining pieces are stitched together at the back and toe seams,Relevant
The upper pieces are stitched together in the same manner,Relevant
Stiffening material called a counter and usually made of leather or plastic is inserted from the ball of the boot around the heel to the middle of the arch to provide support for the ankle,Relevant
Reinforcement pieces are cemented onto the underside of the upper with latex or neoprene base cement,Relevant
Foam padding is layered on top of the reinforcement,Relevant
The lining is then sewn onto the upper boot through all three layers,Relevant
Excess edges are trimmed,Relevant
A line of top stitching provides additional support and decoration,Relevant
The eyelet placket is also reinforced by means of a strip of leather,Relevant
The tongue is lined with sponge rubber then tacked first to the lining and then to the boot upper using a cross butterfly stitch,Relevant
The partially constructed boot is then subjected to a heat and moisture process called mulling that leaves the leather more pliable,Relevant
The boot is shaped by placing it on a last which is a plastic foot form corresponding to a particular shoe size and width,Relevant
The lasts resemble shoe trees,Irrelevant
A skate manufacturer can have as many as 102 sizes and widths for women and as many as 57 sizes for men,Irrelevant
This large difference in number of lasts may be due to several factors there are more women skaters particularly in figure skating than men thus increasing the variety demanded,Irrelevant
In addition women may be more particular about fit as evidenced by the wider variety of width and sizes for women s street shoes than men s,Irrelevant
First an insole is tacked onto the last,Relevant
Then the boot is pulled tight by hand over the bottom of the last,Relevant
The worker must make sure that all wrinkles are eliminated working from the arch to the heel then from the arch to the toe,Relevant
Tacks or cement adhere the arch heel and toe to the insole,Irrelevant
The tacks holding the insole to the last are removed,Relevant
The boot still stretched over the last is placed into a drying chamber,Relevant
Heat is applied to set the boot to the length and width of the last,Relevant
A worker then removes the last from the interior of the skate boot,Relevant
The boot is placed upside down on a peg under an electric grinder to remove the leather finish from the boot bottom,Relevant
The grinding process causes a crevice to form across the middle of the boot bottom where the foot s natural arch occurs,Irrelevant
This crevice is packed with a synthetic filler and an 18 gauge spring steel arch support shank,Relevant
A leather or rubber sole is then attached to the boot with a urethane base cement,Relevant
The heel is constructed by gluing square stacks of leather or water repellent fiberboard on top of each other,Relevant
The height and width of the heel varies with the type of skate,Irrelevant
The heel is glued onto the boot and then six to ten long nails are driven through the heel outsole and insole,Relevant
Finally the heel is trimmed and smoothed,Relevant
The sole and heel plates of the blade are lined up with the sole and heel area of the boot bottom,Relevant
The worker eyes the placement making sure that the blade is centered on the sole,Relevant
An equal amount of boot bottom should be exposed at the toe and heel,Relevant
The worker then screws the blade onto the boot using a high speed drill on a foot powered press,Relevant
Only a few of the screws are inserted into the boot the remainder are packaged with the ice skates,Relevant
This allows the skater to adjust the blade as necessary before the remaining screws are inserted and tightened,Relevant
However the blades of skates fitted with rubber soles are permanently attached with rivets,Relevant
The completed skate is hand polished and sprayed with a solution to make it shine,Relevant
Laces are threaded through the eyelets,Relevant
The skates are then boxed for shipping,Relevant
In line skates are manufactured using an assembly line process whereby all components move down a conveyor belt and are assembled piece by piece,Irrelevant
In line boot shells are made by a process called injection molding,Irrelevant
Urethane plastic is injected into a mold to form the boot shell much like a ski boot,Relevant
Dye may be added for color,Relevant
When the mold has cooled the injection molding machine ejects the finished boot,Relevant
Soft cloth or plastic foam is cut to various sizes and inserted into the boot shell,Relevant
The dimensions of the liner should conform to the skater s foot,Relevant
The remaining shell cuff as well as the tongue metal buckles and plastic or velcro fasteners are attached to the shell,Relevant
Most of these pieces are bought prefabricated,Irrelevant
The frame including wheels and bearings is attached to the boot shell by rivets or by a coupling system,Relevant
The frame is often assembled ahead of time,Relevant
The wheels are placed in a row and attached to the frame,Relevant
On inexpensive models the boot and frame are injection molded as one unit,Irrelevant
Once the in line skate has been assembled it is boxed and delivered to stores,Relevant
Every robot begins with the design phase,Irrelevant
These and other factors must be accounted for in the design job to be performed speed of operation environment of operation hazardous materials involved length of reach path of travel process variables human involvement controller capability and result of failures,Irrelevant
Most manufacturers have a basic machine design to which they incorporate modifications and accessories to meet the specific requirements of the application,Irrelevant
Once designed the base arms column and supports are fabricated,Relevant
The base is usually heavy to prevent the robot from tipping over,Irrelevant
It is made by casting or by welding then machined,Irrelevant
Many robot manufacturers use robots to weld parts for new ones,Irrelevant
Those areas that mate with the rest of the robot are machined with close dimensional control to assure proper fit and operation of the attaching components,Irrelevant
Likewise the main column and arms are constructed to fit accurately into the final assembly,Relevant
Robots are assembled using a substantial amount of purchased components such as electric motors hydraulic cylinders bearings wiring controllers and other important parts,Irrelevant
To begin the assembly process mobile robots first have the traction motors batteries axles wheels and tires mounted,Relevant
Stationary robots do not require these items,Irrelevant
They are temporarily bolted to the floor for stability during assembly,Relevant
The moving columns and arms are subassembled with their respective drive motors and then attached to the base,Relevant
The base contains a ring gear that is motor driven to provide the turning motion,Irrelevant
It must mate closely with the drive gear contained in the column,Irrelevant
Thrust bearings support the weight of column and arms on the base,Irrelevant
A magnetic scale surrounds the bearing and provides electronic position feedback to the controller,Irrelevant
The next joint is the link,Irrelevant
It acts like an elbow and connects the arm to the base,Irrelevant
A stabilizer support provides positional control to the link allowing it to move in a predetermined path,Irrelevant
These components contain bearing mounts into which pivot shafts are bolted,Irrelevant
Each bearing is prelubricated or provided with a lubrication line or fitting,Relevant
The link contains a position sensor which provides another position signal to the controller,Irrelevant
The arm is assembled onto the upright portion of the link,Relevant
It provides the most reach to the robot and supports the wrist,Irrelevant
The arm contains the drive shafts that operate the wrist,Irrelevant
Three motors or a combination of motors and hydraulic cylinders are connected to the drive shafts,Relevant
Since the arm and link joint must withstand the entire load of the wrist this is accomplished with large bearings and a pivot pin,Relevant
An industrial robot can contain 2 000 individual parts and is assembled by teams,Irrelevant
These teams begin with the base and assemble components into the robot until it is complete and ready for testing and finishing,Irrelevant
The wrist is the critical mechanism of the robot,Irrelevant
It is the wrist that most replicates human motion by twisting and turning to place the paint gun welder or other tool in the correct position,Irrelevant
Many robots also have load sensing electronics in the wrist to signal when an obstruction has been hit or when a load is too heavy to safely pick up,Irrelevant
Additional position sensors and tool control electronics are also assembled into the arm and wrist,Irrelevant
Once the mechanical assembly has been completed the wiring and plumbing of the robot can be finished,Relevant
All of the motor s sensors and electrical components must have wires for power and to carry information back to the control computer,Relevant
Occasionally unused space in the arms and base provides a handy place to mount some of the controller electronics shortening the wiring paths,Irrelevant
Hydraulic and air cylinders have hoses that carry pressure to operate them controlled from the valves in the base,Irrelevant
Most of these wires and hoses are routed back to the controller cabinet which for mobile robots is attached to the base,Irrelevant
If the robot is stationary this controller is usually mounted several feet away and is connected by an umbilical cord,Irrelevant
After assembly the arms and column of the robot are sometimes covered with guards and shields to protect them from paint spray welding sparks or other hazards in the environment,Relevant
Installation occurs at the user s site,Relevant
If stationary the robot is secured to the floor with bolts,Relevant
If moving a guide wire is buried into the floor for the robot to follow from task to task,Relevant
It follows the wire by radio signals and also uses the wire to communicate with the central controller,Irrelevant
Recently lasers have been used to eliminate the wire,Irrelevant
The robot is guided through its path by a laser beam reflected off the walls,Relevant
Some designs also incorporate video cameras,Irrelevant
Stationary applications usually require that fences be constructed around the robot so an unsuspecting human doesn t wander into the robot s work area and be injured,Irrelevant
After installation the robot manufacturer usually provides operation and maintenance training to the customer,Relevant
Hundreds of integrated circuits are made at the same time on a single thin slice of silicon and are then cut apart into individual IC chips,Irrelevant
The manufacturing process takes place in a tightly controlled environment known as a clean room where the air is filtered to remove foreign particles,Relevant
The few equipment operators in the room wear lint free garments gloves and coverings for their heads and feet,Relevant
Since some IC components are sensitive to certain frequencies of light even the light sources are filtered,Irrelevant
Although manufacturing processes may vary depending on the integrated circuit being made the following process is typical,Irrelevant
A cylindrical ingot of silicon about 1 5 to 4 0 inches 3 8 to 10 2 cm in diameter is held vertically inside a vacuum chamber with a high temperature heating coil encircling it,Relevant
Starting at the top of the cylinder the silicon is heated to its melting point of about 2550 F 1400 C ,Relevant
To avoid contamination the heated region is contained only by the surface tension of the molten silicon,Irrelevant
As the region melts any impurities in the silicon become mobile,Irrelevant
The heating coil is slowly moved down the length of the cylinder and the impurities are carried along with the melted region,Relevant
When the heating coil reaches the bottom almost all of the impurities have been swept along and are concentrated there,Relevant
The bottom is then sliced off leaving a cylindrical ingot of purified silicon,Relevant
A thin round wafer of silicon is cut off the ingot using a precise cutting machine called a wafer slicer,Relevant
Each slice is about 0 01 to 0 025 inches 0 004 to 0 01 cm thick,Irrelevant
The surface on which the integrated circuits are to be formed is polished,Relevant
The surfaces of the wafer are coated with a layer of silicon dioxide to form an insulating base and to prevent any oxidation of the silicon which would cause impurities,Relevant
The silicon dioxide is formed by subjecting the wafer to superheated steam at about 1830 F 1000 C under several atmospheres of pressure to allow the oxygen in the water vapor to react with the silicon,Irrelevant
Controlling the temperature and length of exposure controls the thickness of the silicon dioxide layer,Irrelevant
The complex and interconnected design of the circuits and components is prepared in a process similar to that used to make printed circuit boards,Irrelevant
For ICs however the dimensions are much smaller and there are many layers superimposed on top of each other,Irrelevant
The design of each layer is prepared on a computer aided drafting machine and the image is made into a mask which will be optically reduced and transferred to the surface of the wafer,Relevant
The mask is opaque in certain areas and clear in others,Irrelevant
It has the images for all of the several hundred integrated circuits to be formed on the wafer,Irrelevant
A drop of photoresist material is placed in the center of the silicon wafer and the wafer is spun rapidly to distribute the photoresist over the entire surface,Relevant
The photoresist is then baked to remove the solvent,Relevant
The coated wafer is then placed under the first layer mask and irradiated with light,Relevant
Because the spaces between circuits and components are so small ultraviolet light with a very short wavelength is used to squeeze through the tiny clear areas on the mask,Irrelevant
Beams of electrons or x rays are also sometimes used to irradiate the photoresist,Irrelevant
The mask is removed and portions of the photoresist are dissolved,Relevant
If a positive photoresist was used then the areas that were irradiated will be dissolved,Relevant
If a negative photoresist was used then the areas that were irradiated will remain,Relevant
The uncovered areas are then either chemically etched to open up a layer or are subjected to chemical doping to create a layer of P or N regions,Relevant
One method of adding dopants to create a layer of P or N regions is atomic diffusion,Irrelevant
In this method a batch of wafers is placed in an oven made of a quartz tube surrounded by a heating element,Relevant
The wafers are heated to an operating temperature of about 1500 2200 F 816 1205 C and the dopant chemical is carried in on an inert gas,Relevant
As the dopant and gas pass over the wafers the dopant is deposited on the hot surfaces left exposed by the masking process,Relevant
This method is good for doping relatively large areas but is not accurate for smaller areas,Irrelevant
There are also some problems with the repeated use of high temperatures as successive layers are added,Irrelevant
The second method to add dopants is ion implantation,Irrelevant
In this method a dopant gas like phosphine or boron trichloride is ionized to provide a beam of high energy dopant ions which are fired at specific regions of the wafer,Relevant
The ions penetrate the wafer and remain implanted,Relevant
The depth of penetration can be controlled by altering the beam energy and the amount of dopant can be controlled by altering the beam current and time of exposure,Relevant
Schematically the whole process resembles firing a beam in a bent cathode ray tube,Relevant
This method is so precise it does not require maskingit just points and shoots the dopant where it is needed,Irrelevant
However it is much slower than the atomic diffusion process,Irrelevant
The process of masking and etching or doping is repeated for each successive layer depending on the doping process used until all of the integrated circuit chips are complete,Relevant
Sometimes a layer of silicon dioxide is laid down to provide an insulator between layers or components,Relevant
This is done through a process known as chemical vapor deposition in which the wafer s surface is heated to about 752 F 400 C and a reaction between the gases silane and oxygen deposits a layer of silicon dioxide,Irrelevant
A final silicon dioxide layer seals the surface a final etching opens up contact points and a layer of aluminum is deposited to make the contact pads,Relevant
At this point the individual ICs are tested for electrical function,Relevant
The thin wafer is like a piece of glass,Irrelevant
The hundreds of individual chips are separated by scoring a crosshatch of lines with a fine diamond cutter and then putting the wafer under stress to cause each chip to separate,Relevant
Those ICs that failed the electrical test are discarded,Relevant
Inspection under a microscope reveals other ICs that were damaged by the separation process and these are also discarded,Relevant
The good ICs are individually bonded into their mounting package and the thin wire leads are connected by either ultrasonic bonding or thermocompression,Relevant
The mounting package is marked with identifying part numbers and other information,Relevant
The completed integrated circuits are sealed in anti static plastic bags to be stored or shipped to the end user,Relevant
After processing the ore is blended with other ore and goes to the blast furnace,Relevant
A blast furnace is a tower shaped structure made of steel and lined with refractory or heat resistant bricks,Irrelevant
The mixture of raw material or charge enters at the top of the blast furnace,Relevant
At the bottom of the furnace very hot air is blown or blasted in through nozzles called tuye res,Relevant
The coke burns in the presence of the hot air,Relevant
The oxygen in the air reacts with the carbon in the coke to form carbon monoxide,Relevant
The carbon monoxide then reacts with the iron ore to form carbon dioxide and pure iron,Relevant
The melted iron sinks to the bottom of the furnace,Relevant
The limestone combines with the rock and other impurities in the ore to form a slag which is lighter than the iron and floats on top,Relevant
As the volume of the charge is reduced more is continually added at the top of the furnace,Relevant
The iron and slag are drawn off separately from the bottom of the furnace,Relevant
The melted iron might go to a further alloying process or might be cast into ingots called pigs,Relevant
The slag is carried away for disposal,Relevant
The hot gases produced in the chemical reactions are drawn off at the top and routed to a gas cleaning plant where they are cleaned or scrubbed and sent back into the furnace the remaining carbon monoxide in particular is useful to the chemical reactions going on within the furnace,Relevant
A blast furnace normally runs day and night for several years,Irrelevant
Eventually the brick lining begins to crumble and the furnace is then shut down for maintenance,Relevant
Each manufacturer s jelly bean and each new flavor color combination begin in a chemistry laboratory where the right balance of ingredients is mixed and developed in test batches,Irrelevant
New designer flavors are suggested based on marketing studies and the flavors are tested for taste and visual appeal in the laboratory,Irrelevant
Subsequently a new flavor will be manufactured over a trial time period and test marketed,Irrelevant
If the flavor proves popular it will become a new product,Irrelevant
The chemists also develop new flavors with an eye toward the consumer s interest in natural products and they evaluate its nutrition facts including ingredients and caloric content,Irrelevant
After the chemists have fine tuned their recipe the candy kitchen creates the syrup that forms the jelly bean center by dissolving the sugar and other ingredients in large boilers where the syrup is cooked to the proper temperature and consistency,Irrelevant
Flavor and color for the bean center are added to the syrup which is then piped to the starch casting area,Relevant
The kitchens also mix and cook the flavor and color syrups for the panning process described below,Relevant
These syrups are carefully transported to the panning room and are added in measured doses during panning,Relevant
Formation or shaping of a single jelly bean begins with a process called starch casting,Irrelevant
Dry corn starch is a fine white powder that retains impressions or shapes well,Irrelevant
A machine called a mogul deposits a layer of corn starch in a plastic tray and moves the tray to a machine die which presses dents into the corn starch,Irrelevant
Each tray may contain several hundred to over 1 200 of these impressions or dents each of which is the size and shape of the center of a jelly bean,Irrelevant
The mogul moves the trays to a depositor or filling station where heated candy syrup is squirted into the tiny molds,Relevant
From the mogul conveyors carefully move the trays to cooling rooms in which temperature and humidity are controlled and where the liquid candy cools and sets up to form the gummy center of the jelly bean,Relevant
The panning process gives the jelly beans their outer color and flavor protective sugar shells and shiny glaze,Irrelevant
The trays of candy centers are dumped out,Relevant
The corn starch absorbs moisture from them during the cooling process but it is removed dried reprocessed and recycled to create molds for more candies,Relevant
The centers which are all the same flavor and color are placed in stainless steel vessels called pans that are globe shaped and hollow with an opening at one pole of the globe,Relevant
Just like globes the pans are tilted on their axes so the candies can be placed in them easily and so workers can add other ingredients through the openings,Relevant
At the bottom pole or axis end the vessel is linked to a rotating power source,Relevant
The pans rotate the jelly bean centers several hundred times per minute,Relevant
Sugar is added through the opening which gradually builds up on the soft center to form a harder sugar shell,Relevant
Workers add colors and flavors during the panning process by pouring beakers of syrup supplied by the candy kitchen through the opening in the vessel,Irrelevant
They can also observe the jelly bean shells as they form and become colored throughout the process,Irrelevant
The beans are essentially finished at this point but are rather dull looking,Relevant
To give them their glossy coats a glaze of confectioner s sugar is added while the beans are still revolving in the pans,Relevant
The process of making the jelly bean takes 6 to 10 days depending on the kind of bean and the manufacturer,Irrelevant
Packaging is the final step before sending the jelly beans to distributors,Irrelevant
Jelly beans are placed in trays after panning and are still segregated by color or flavor,Relevant
The trays of candies are taken to a large bin where they are dumped in and mixed to the desired combination of colors and flavors,Relevant
The mixing bin is a large rotating cylinder,Irrelevant
On one side a grid is set in the wall of the bin,Relevant
Beans that are too small fall through the openings in the grid and into a receiving bin while beans that are too large stick in the mesh and are removed later,Irrelevant
The beans that continue rotating are therefore only the desired size and shape,Relevant
They fall from the mixing bin onto a conveyor where workers inspect them and remove any candies that look imperfect,Relevant
The beans that pass inspection move on the conveyor to a packaging machine where the candy is weighed and bagged in any of several sizes of bags either for bulk sale or purchase by individual consumers,Relevant
The packaging machine can package and seal about 80 000 bags of jelly beans a day,Relevant
Exceptions to the sorting and mixing process occur when jelly beans usually the gourmet type are packaged by single flavor or when the flavors are separated in small compartments in gift or sampler boxes that let the taster experience the unique flavors of designer beans,Irrelevant
The candies are still sized and inspected but individual flavors are then placed in funnel like bins,Relevant
The small openings fit the compartments in plastic trays in the gift boxes and a controlled quantity of each flavor is dropped into its specific tray compartment,Relevant
Although the candies are thoroughly mixed to try to get an equal distribution of colors the randomness of conveying and sorting may cause some variations in the mix,Relevant
The consumer who purchases the larger bag has a better chance statistically of getting a near equal distribution of colors and flavors,Relevant
Slight variations in size and shape account for one bag of jelly beans containing more beans than the next even though the contents are weighed,Irrelevant
Some manufacturers put more than the stated weight in each package so the customer may actually get more beans than paid for in each bag,Relevant
The body of a polyethylene kayak is a long hollow shell of uniform thickness made by a process called rotational molding,Irrelevant
After the shell is made the seat and other components are added in a manual assembly process,Relevant
The shell may be molded in one piece or it may be made from two separate pieces which are joined later,Relevant
Rotational molding requires fairly rounded contours so one piece shells cannot have sharp intersections between surfaces,Irrelevant
If the design requires a sharper intersectionsuch as between the hull and the deck for examplethen a two piece shell is used,Irrelevant
The process for making the two piece shell is described here,Irrelevant
Measured amounts of powdered or granulated polyethylene plastic are mixed with coloring agents and an exact amount is loaded into the bottom of a two piece thin walled aluminum mold for either the hull or the deck,Relevant
The mold is then closed and the two halves secured tightly,Relevant
The mold is held by a mechanical arm which can rotate the mold in two directions at the same time,Relevant
The arm can also move or index the mold from one process station to another,Relevant
After the mold is loaded it is moved to the heating station where an oven heats it to 480 840 F 250 450 C ,Relevant
As the heat from the mold melts the plastic the mold is slowly rotated in two directions,Relevant
Gravitational force causes the melted plastic to flow to the front and rear and up the sides of the rotating mold eventually covering the entire surface with a uniformly thick skin of plastic,Relevant
Continued heating then fuses the plastic into a solid layer that attaches itself to the mold,Relevant
Next the mold is indexed to the cooling chamber,Relevant
By continuing to rotate the mold and gradually cooling it with carefully directed sprays of air and then water the kayak hull or deck further hardens and shrinks away from the mold,Relevant
Repeated cycles of heating and cooling may be required to form the kayak properly,Relevant
After the final cooling the hull or deck is removed from the mold,Relevant
The hull and deck are designed so that they fit together at a single seam running horizontally along the length of the boat,Irrelevant
Careful sealing ensures that the shell acts as a single structural unit,Irrelevant
After sealing a decorative strip can be added to conceal the seam,Relevant
On some designs a keel stiffener is bonded along the length of the shell to give it added strength,Relevant
Closed cell foam flotation aids are inserted into each end of the kayak and held in place with adhesive,Relevant
Some kayaks use inflatable flotation bags instead,Irrelevant
These flotation aids keep the kayak level and floating on the surface should the craft capsize,Irrelevant
If the kayak design uses bulkheads then those pieces are bonded in place and sealed with a polyurethane sealant,Irrelevant
The seat is either suspended from straps attached to the sides or supported by a piece of foam bonded to the inside of the bottom of the hull,Relevant
Adjustable foot braces or rudder pedals are attached to the inside of the shell forward of the cockpit using non corrosive metal fasteners,Relevant
The hatch covers have waterproof gaskets installed before they are put in place and the grab loops are installed,Relevant
Finally a drain plug is inserted in a molded hole in the shell,Relevant
Kayaks are relatively large but light weight,Irrelevant
Packaging to protect the shell from abrasion is more important than providing a strong support,Relevant
Traditional methods of preparing a kayak for shipping include shrink wrapping in plastic or placing the kayak in a cardboard box,Irrelevant
One environmentally sensitive approach uses heavy tarp like cloth bags,Irrelevant
Ketchup manufacturers must seek out the best quality tomatoes for their product,Irrelevant
Tomato varieties are developed which are superior in color flavor texture and yield,Relevant
Consistency is an important factor as slight variations in tomato characteristics could alter the flavor and color of the finished product,Irrelevant
Tomatoes are harvested mechanically between June and July,Relevant
The fruit is commonly conveyed by water from the trucks into a flume or an inclined channel,Relevant
The water method washes the tomatoes and protects them from bruising while they pass from the truck to the factory,Irrelevant
The U S Department of Agriculture or state inspectors approve and grade tomatoes to meet initial requirements,Irrelevant
The tomatoes are sorted washed and chopped,Relevant
Next precooking or scaling in stainless steel vats preserves the tomatoes and destroys bacteria,Relevant
The chopped and precooked tomatoes are pumped into pulping machines or cyclones which separate seeds skins and stems from the pulp,Relevant
The pulp and juice are filtered through screens and processed further into ketchup though some may be stored in a paste for use later in the year,Relevant
The pulp is pumped into cooking tanks or kettles and heated to boiling,Relevant
Foaming may occur if fresh tomato pulp is used but can be corrected with anti foaming compounds or compressed air,Irrelevant
Precise amounts of sweeteners vinegar salt spices and flavorings are added to the tomato pulp,Relevant
Most spices are added early in the cooking process,Relevant
To avoid excessive evaporation volatile spice oils and vinegar must be mixed in later,Relevant
Onions and garlic can be mixed in with the spices placed in a separate bag or chopped and added to the pulp,Relevant
Salt and sugar may be added at any stage of cooking though it is better to add sugar later to prevent burning,Relevant
The mixture cooks for 30 45 minutes and is circulated by rotating blades installed in the cookers,Relevant
The temperature must be carefully regulated to insure absorption of the ingredients without overcooking which creates a flat body,Relevant
Once the cooking is complete the ketchup mixture passes through a finishing machine,Relevant
Finishers remove excess fiber and particles through screens creating a smoother consistency,Relevant
The ketchup passes to a holding tank before further processing,Relevant
The ketchup may be milled at higher temperatures and pressures to achieve a smoother consistency,Relevant
The ketchup must be de aerated to prevent discoloration and growth of bacteria,Relevant
Excess air might also create unattractive air pockets and impede the closure process,Relevant
To prevent contamination the ketchup passes from the receiving tanks to the filling machines at a temperature not lower than 190 F 88 C ,Relevant
The containers are filled with the ketchup and immediately sealed to retain the freshness of the product,Relevant
Ketchup containers come in various sizes and shapes including 14 oz bottles No 10 cans pouch packs room service sizes and single serve packets,Irrelevant
The containers must be cooled to prevent flavor loss through stack burning which occurs when ketchup stays at high temperatures after cooking is complete,Relevant
Containers of ketchup may be cooled in cold air or cold water,Relevant
Finally the ketchup containers are labeled and coded with product information including ingredients date and location of manufacture and shelf life,Relevant
The bottled ketchup may be inspected again before shipping,Relevant
The entire process of ketchup manufacturing generally takes two to three hours,Irrelevant
The first step in retrieving lead bearing ore is to mine it underground,Irrelevant
Workers using heavy machinery drill the rock from deep tunnels with heavy machinery or blast it with dynamite leaving the ore in pieces,Relevant
Then they shovel the ore onto loaders and trucks and haul it to a shaft,Relevant
The shaft at a large mine may be a mile or more from the drill or blast site,Irrelevant
The miners dump the ore down the shaft and from there it is hoisted to the surface,Relevant
After the ore is removed from the mine it is treated at a concentrating mill,Relevant
Concentrating means to remove the waste rock from the lead,Relevant
To begin the ore must be crushed into very small pieces,Relevant
The ore is ground at the mill leaving it in particles with diameters of 0 1 millimeter or less,Relevant
This means the individual granules are finer than table salt,Irrelevant
The texture is something like granulated sugar,Irrelevant
The principal lead ore galena is properly known as lead sulfide and sulfur makes up a substantial portion of the mineral,Irrelevant
The flotation process collects the sulfur bearing portions of the ore which also contains the valuable metal,Irrelevant
First the finely crushed ore is diluted with water and then poured into a tank called a flotation cell,Relevant
The ground ore and water mixture is called slurry,Irrelevant
One percent pine oil or a similar chemical is then added to the slurry in the tank,Relevant
The tank then agitates shaking the mixture violently,Relevant
The pine oil attracts the sulfide particles,Relevant
Then air is bubbled through the mixture,Relevant
This causes the sulfide particles to form an oily froth at the top of the tank,Irrelevant
The waste rock which is called gangue sinks to the bottom,Relevant
The flotation process is controlled by means of X ray analyzers,Relevant
A flotation monitor in the control room can check the metal content of the slurry using the X ray analysis,Relevant
Then with the aid of a computer the monitor may adjust the proportion of the chemical additive to optimize recovery of the metal,Relevant
Other chemicals are also added to the flotation cell to help concentrate the minerals,Relevant
Alum and lime aggregate the metal or make the particles larger,Relevant
Xanthate is also added to the slurry in order to help the metal particles float to the surface,Relevant
At the end of the flotation process the lead has been separated from the rock and other minerals too such as zinc and copper have been separated out,Relevant
After the ore is concentrated in the flotation cells it flows to a filter which removes up to 90% of the water,Relevant
The concentrate at this point contains from 40 80% lead with large amounts of other impurities mostly sulfur and zinc,Irrelevant
It is ready at this stage to be shipped to the smelter,Irrelevant
The gangue or rock that was not mineral bearing must be pumped out of the flotation tank,Relevant
It may be dumped into a pond resembling a natural lake and when the pond eventually fills the land can be replanted,Relevant
The lead concentrate fresh from the filter needs to be further refined to remove the sulfur,Irrelevant
After the concentrate is unloaded at what is called the sinter plant it is mixed with other lead bearing materials and with sand and limestone,Relevant
Then the mixture is spread on a moving grate,Relevant
Air which has been heated to 2 550 F 1 400 C blows through the grate,Relevant
Coke is added as fuel and the sulfur in the ore concentrate combusts to sulfur dioxide gas,Relevant
This sulfur dioxide is an important byproduct of the lead refining process,Irrelevant
It is captured at a separate acid plant and converted to sulfuric acid which has many uses,Relevant
After the ore has been roasted in this way it fuses into a brittle material called sinter,Relevant
The sinter is mostly lead oxide but it can also contain oxides of zinc iron and silicon some lime and sulfur,Relevant
As the sinter passes off the moving grate it is broken into lumps,Relevant
The lumps are then loaded into the blast furnace,Relevant
The sinter falls into the top of the blast furnace along with coke fuel,Relevant
A blast of air comes through the lower part of the furnace combusting the coke,Relevant
The burning coke generates a temperature of about 2 200 F 1 200 C and produces carbon monoxide,Relevant
The carbon monoxide reacts with the lead and other metal oxides producing molten lead nonmetallic waste slag and carbon dioxide,Relevant
Then the molten metal is drawn off into drossing kettles or molds,Relevant
The molten lead as it comes from the blast furnace is from 95 99% pure,Relevant
It is called at this point base bullion,Irrelevant
It must be further refined to remove impurities because commercial lead must be from 99 99 999% pure,Relevant
To refine the bullion it is kept in the drossing kettle at a temperature just above its melting point about 626 F 330 C ,Relevant
At this temperature any copper left in the bullion rises to the top of the kettle and forms a scum or dross which can be skimmed off,Relevant
Gold and silver can be removed from the bullion by adding to it a small quantity of zinc,Relevant
The gold and silver dissolves more easily in zinc than in lead and when the bullion is cooled slightly a zinc dross rises to the top bringing the other metals with it,Relevant
When the lead has been sufficiently refined it is cooled and cast into blocks which may weigh as much as a ton,Relevant
This is the finished product,Irrelevant
Lead alloys may also be produced at the smelter plant,Relevant
In this case metals are added to the molten lead in precise proportions to produce a lead material for specific industrial uses,Relevant
For example the lead commonly used in car batteries and also for pipe sheet cable sheathing and ammunition is alloyed with antimony because this increases the metal s strength,Irrelevant
The skins are trimmed and sorted according to size weight and thickness,Relevant
It is necessary to remove any remaining proteins that could stimulate the growth of bacteria,Relevant
To this end the skins are soaked in revolving drums filled with water bactericides and detergents,Relevant
Hair is removed with the application of chemical sprays or lime solutions,Relevant
A scudding machine fitted with dull blades scrapes off any excess hair,Relevant
Another round of washing de liming removes these chemicals before the hides are soaked in an acid solution and then bated an enzyme treatment to further remove the skins collagens,Relevant
Finally the hides are pickled with salt and sulfuric acid,Relevant
The hides undergo one of three types of tanning,Irrelevant
Vegetable tanning requires the most time with the skins soaked in progressively stronger tannic acid solutions for several weeks,Relevant
However some soft leathers such as lambskin may be soaked for as little as 12 hours,Irrelevant
Mineral tanning is significantly faster but can change the color of the leather,Irrelevant
For this method the skins are placed in alum salt filled drums fitted with paddles that provide a constant agitating motion,Relevant
The third method oil tanning is the one that resembles the ancient methods most closely,Irrelevant
Here fish oil is sprayed onto the skins,Relevant
After the skins have been tanned they are washed once again and wrung out thoroughly,Relevant
Then the skins are passed under a band knife which cuts the skins to a uniform thickness and placed on conveyer belts which carry them to drying tunnels,Relevant
Usually the skins are stretched on frames to prevent shrinkage during the drying stage,Relevant
To combat the stiffness that drying produces the hides are sprayed with water and soap and allowed to hang for a period of time,Relevant
After the skins have been conditioned they are placed in machines designed to rhythmically manipulate the leather so that the fibers are further loosened and made more flexible,Relevant
In the final drying period the hides are hung in vacuum drying cabinets,Relevant
When the skins are thoroughly dried they are buffed with revolving steel cylinders covered with abrasive paper,Relevant
Suede finishes are produced by passing the hides under high speed emery wheels,Relevant
At this point glazes dyes and lacquers are applied,Relevant
The skins are now ready to be sent to the garment factory,Relevant
The development of high speed sewing machinery changed the face of traditional sewing factories where one person may have worked on a single garment from start to finish,Irrelevant
Because leather garments are considered luxury items hand construction by highly skilled artisans is still sought by many consumers,Irrelevant
However the following steps are those used in factory mass production,Irrelevant
Garment manufacturers typically employ designers to create patterns from which the clothing is made,Relevant
Computerized machines grade the designs according to government anthropometric tables which assign sizes based on body height and weight,Irrelevant
The computer then produces patterns in a range of sizes from the original design,Relevant
The tanned leather is placed on moving tables called spreaders,Relevant
Although modern technology allows several layers of fabric to be cut simultaneously leather is usually cut one layer at a time,Relevant
The pattern is placed on top of the leather,Relevant
This is accomplished in one of two ways tissue paper patterns may be pinned onto the leather or the pattern may be marked with tailor s chalk,Irrelevant
The spreading table works on the conveyer system moving the fabric to the cutting machine which is fitted with either rotary blades or band knives,Relevant
The table is either guided by a human operator or run automatically,Irrelevant
The most recent technological advance is the computerized laser beam system in which the fabric seams are vaporized rather than cut,Irrelevant
Lining material for the jacket is cut in the same manner,Relevant
Because it is of a much thinner weight lining can be placed on the spreaders in multiple layers,Irrelevant
The jacket is assembled in roughly this order the sides are stitched to the back portion sleeve underseams are stitched together and the sleeves are attached to the armholes,Relevant
The attachment of finishing pieces such as collars cuffs buttonholes buttons zippers and pockets varies according to the design of the jacket,Relevant
Patch pockets are sewn onto the side pieces before they are stitched to the back portion and side pockets are sewn in at the same time that the sides are attached to the back,Relevant
Generally lining material is attached to each piece before it is sewn onto the jacket,Relevant
In mass production the pieces are moved along a highly sophisticated production line using integrated automatic sewing machines that are capable of sewing as many as 8 000 stitches per minute,Relevant
In a sequential system one sewing machine stitches a particular section of the jacket and then moves the garment to another sewing machine which performs the next step,Relevant
For example after one machine stitches a cuff to the sleeve the sleeve moves to another machine where it is attached to the jacket armhole,Irrelevant
A tandem sewing system calls for two or more machines to work on the same garment simultaneously,Irrelevant
In this instance one machine attaches buttons to the front of the jacket while another machine applies the collar,Relevant
Each step from setting thread and needle positions to aligning the fabric to extracting the sewed materials is pre programmed,Irrelevant
Each sewing machine is equipped with under bed trimming devices that automatically knot and cut threads after each seam is sewn,Irrelevant
Excess threads are carried away to waste receptacles by streams of compressed air,Relevant
Operators regulate the work at each station with a modified presser foot or from a control panel,Relevant
A stop motion device allows the operator to halt production to make adjustments such as replacing broken threads or needles,Irrelevant
A number of pressing processes incorporating heat application steaming and blocking are employed to complete the transformation of the animal skins into a jacket,Irrelevant
Buck presses equipped with controls and gauges to regulate the amount of steam and pressure are used to give the jacket its distinctive shape whether a bomber or blazer styled jacket,Irrelevant
Curved blocks are placed around the collars and cuffs and then heat is applied,Relevant
The blocks are removed leaving the collars and cuffs curved,Relevant
Each jacket is inspected by hand before it leaves the factory floor,Relevant
The completed jackets are then sheathed in plastic bags packed into cartons and shipped to the retailer,Relevant
The steps in the manufacture of life vests are similar to those for any automated garment manufacturing process differing in specific features such as raw materials and more importantly safety specifications,Irrelevant
The operations necessary to complete a garment from scratch are known in the industry as cut fit trim,Irrelevant
As many as 100 life vests may be manufactured simultaneously in an automated manufacturing process such as the one described here,Irrelevant
Pattern designs are digitally fed from a computer into a machine called a plotter which draws a stencil of the pattern design on long sheets of white paper,Relevant
The drawn sheets are called markers,Irrelevant
A machine called a spreader unrolls a bolt of nylon fabric along a table usually 66 72 inches 168 183 cm wide and up to 100 feet 31 m long,Relevant
Thin fabrics such as nylon may be layered 25 deep for cutting,Irrelevant
Wrinkles are smoothed by the spreader or by hand and the marker is laid on top of the nylon,Irrelevant
Some manufacturers use an automated cutting machine to cut the pattern pieces out of the nylon,Relevant
Other manufacturers may cut the pieces by hand using a portable motor driven straight knife which resembles a jig saw,Relevant
In automated cutting the digital pattern is fed into the cutting machine,Irrelevant
A sheet of cellophane wider than the fabric is drawn over the top of the marker and fabric layers,Relevant
A vacuum pulls the cellophane down tight against the table holding the marker and nylon layers in place,Relevant
A knife cuts the pattern out of cellophane marker and fabric layers at the same time,Relevant
The cut pattern pieces are then bundled for transfer to assembly areas,Relevant
The marker which can be read through the cellophane identifies the pattern pieces,Relevant
The closed cell foam is sliced to the desired thickness with a type of band saw called a splitter,Relevant
A band saw has a long thin blade welded in a continuous loop that travels over a driven wheel up and over one or more idler wheels and then down through the material being cut,Irrelevant
The foam then goes through the pattern cutting process in the same way as the nylon,Relevant
Reflective tape and small attachable pieces such as straps are cut from rolls with a smaller cutting machine called a die cutter,Relevant
Sewing professionals each stationed at an industrial sewing machine match the pieces and sew them together,Relevant
The pieces are sewn inside out and then reversed,Relevant
The cut foam pieces are inserted through an open seam which is then sewn shut,Relevant
Straps reflective tape and labels are sewn on last,Relevant
Snaps are attached by an eyelet or riveting machine much like that used by a shoemaker for shoelace holes,Relevant
A computer aided embroidery machinemuch like those used by department stores to personalize towelsis used to embroider brand names and logos,Relevant
Individual finished vests are placed in plastic bags for protection,Relevant
The bags are packed into corrugated boxes and sent to distribution centers,Relevant
Just as the materials are different for different kinds of magnets the manufacturing processes are also different,Irrelevant
Many electromagnets are cast using standard metal casting techniques,Irrelevant
Flexible permanent magnets are formed in a plastic extrusion process in which the materials are mixed heated and forced through a shaped opening under pressure,Relevant
Some magnets are formed using a modified powdered metallurgy process in which finely powdered metal is subjected to pressure heat and magnetic forces to form the final magnet,Relevant
Here is a typical powdered metallurgy process used to produce powerful neodymium iron boron permanent magnets with cross sectional areas of about 3 10 square inches 20 65 sq cm 1 The appropriate amounts of neodymium iron and boron are heated to melting in a vacuum,Relevant
The vacuum prevents any chemical reaction between air and the melting materials that might contaminate the final metal alloy,Relevant
Once the metal has cooled and solidified it is broken up and crushed into small pieces,Relevant
The small pieces are then ground into a fine powder in a ball mill,Relevant
The powdered metal is placed in a mold called a die that is the same length and width or diameter for round magnets as the finished magnet,Relevant
A magnetic force is applied to the powdered material to line up the powder particles,Relevant
While the magnetic force is being applied the powder is pressed from the top and bottom with hydraulic or mechanical rams to compress it to within about 0 125 inches 0 32 cm of its final intended thickness,Relevant
Typical pressures are about 10 000 psi to 15 000 psi 70 MPa to 100 MPa ,Irrelevant
Some shapes are made by placing the powdered material in a flexible air tight evacuated container and pressing it into shape with liquid or gas pressure,Relevant
This is known as isostatic compaction,Irrelevant
The compressed slug of powdered metal is removed from the die and placed in an oven,Relevant
The process of heating compressed powdered metals to transform them into fused solid metal pieces is called sintering,Irrelevant
The process usually consists of three stages,Irrelevant
In the first stage the compressed material is heated at a low temperature to slowly drive off any moisture or other contaminants that may have become entrapped during the pressing process,Relevant
In the second stage the temperature is raised to about 70 90% of the melting point of the metal alloy and held there for a period of several hours or several days to allow the small particles to fuse together,Relevant
Finally the material is cooled down slowly in controlled step by step temperature increments,Relevant
The sintered material then undergoes a second controlled heating and cooling process known as annealing,Relevant
This process removes any residual stresses within the material and strengthens it,Relevant
The annealed material is very close to the finished shape and dimensions desired,Irrelevant
This condition is known as nearnet shape,Irrelevant
A final machining process removes any excess material and produces a smooth surface where needed,Relevant
The material is then given a protective coating to seal the surfaces,Relevant
Up to this point the material is just a piece of compressed and fused metal,Irrelevant
Even though it was subjected to a magnetic force during pressing that force didn t magnetize the material it simply lined up the loose powder particles,Irrelevant
To turn it into a magnet the piece is placed between the poles of a very powerful electromagnet and oriented in the desired direction of magnetization,Relevant
The electromagnet is then energized for a period of time,Relevant
The magnetic force aligns the groups of atoms or magnetic domains within the material to make the piece into a strong permanent magnet,Relevant
Sand soda lime and crushed cullet are fed into a large furnace driven tank,Relevant
In the tank the mixture is heated to 2300 F 1260 C to melt the raw materials,Relevant
This can take as long as 28 hours,Irrelevant
Next the molten mixture moves out of the tank through an opening into another vat known as the flow tank,Relevant
There an opening in the tank injects molten colored glass,Relevant
This hot pigmented glass gives the marbles their distinct appearance,Relevant
A green marble has been injected with glass containing iron oxide cobalt results in a blue marble and manganese will yield a purple one,Relevant
The use of uranium oxide gives marbles an eerie greenish yellow cast,Relevant
The speed and force of the injection determines the final design of the marble,Irrelevant
A grooved feeder device patented by the Akro Agate Company was able to produce multicolored marbles known as corkscrews,Irrelevant
Next the still molten glass is released from the flow tank as globs of glass,Relevant
Automatic cutting devices slice the mixture into equal parts,Relevant
The globs travel down metal ramps that simultaneously cool them and perfect their spherical shape,Relevant
Next they travel down a second metal slide and are sorted by hand,Relevant
These grooved rollers were the invention of Horace Hill a former employee of Christensen and Son and later founder of Akro Agate,Irrelevant
This device produced marbles much more quickly and reduced the labor necessary by nearly two thirds,Irrelevant
Marbles with flaws are sent back to another area of the factory for re melting,Relevant
The marbles cool off in 5 gallon 19 1 containers that house 5 000 marbles at a time,Relevant
The milking machine components are created and assembled in several major manufacturing plants throughout the world using traditional processes and procedures,Relevant
Stainless steel and plastic are used for containers and liners and cast iron and steel for vacuum pumps controls and metering devices,Relevant
Here stainless steel is received in large sheet or tube form,Relevant
Stainless steel is used to fabricate components that will come in contact with milk,Irrelevant
The sheets are protected from scratches by a vinyl lining which will be removed later after forming and machining,Relevant
Milking machine components are created using stainless steel and plastic for containers and liners and cast iron and steel for vacuum pumps controls and metering devices,Relevant
At this point the stainless steel from the foundry has a dull finish,Irrelevant
The steel sheets may be sent directly to a polishing station where large machines create a smooth finish,Relevant
Once the initial finish is achieved the sheets may move on rollers to numerically controlled punch machines where they are cut into shapes for various parts,Relevant
From there some parts are formed or bent into shape on large brakes,Relevant
Mounting panels for controls structural components and small detail parts for the claws and pumps are made at this stage,Irrelevant
The shell that contains the liner is fabricated as an extrusion,Relevant
This process involves forcing steel tubing over a die under heat and pressure to form the elongated rigid piece,Relevant
The claw is made as a series of smaller extruded pieces of tubing that form the manifold which spaces the teatcups in a cluster formation,Relevant
The extrusions are then manually welded together in fixtures according to the desired size,Relevant
Both the completed claws and shell have a dull finish that will require polishing,Relevant
Receiver tanks are stainless steel tanks that receive milk from the milk lines generally holding from 15 26 gallons 60 100 1 ,Relevant
Although some are customized plastic most are steel with the heads or ends spun on specialty machines,Irrelevant
This production technique shapes a thin steel disc as it is being turned in a lathe,Irrelevant
The disc is shaped as it is forced over a steel shape or mandrel,Irrelevant
Once the operator forms the ends of the receiver as cups another technician will weld the body to the head leaving orifices or openings for milk input and output,Relevant
Individually manufactured the receivers will also be polished by hand,Relevant
Some receivers will have translucent plastic panel inserts so that dairy farmers can visually gauge the cow s milk production,Relevant
All major stainless steel components are polished to the familiar finish associated with food handling equipment,Relevant
The manufacturers use a variety of mechanized belts cloths and spinning wheels in what becomes a very labor intensive process to meet government and industry sanitary standards,Relevant
This polishing is in addition to the polishing the large stainless sheets undergo following receiving,Irrelevant
Workers wield an assortment of hand polishers and attachments to shine all contact and protective surfaces from the claws to receivers to pipelines,Irrelevant
These drivers of air and fluids through the system are manufactured by select vendors,Relevant
The unit is basically a sealed iron case with a set of timing gears inside and an impeller resembling two blades or paddles on a shaft that spins at over 3 000 revolutions per minute to create a vacuum that will draw fluids in the line,Irrelevant
The making of the pumps requires raw castings to be poured for the various parts,Irrelevant
The rough parts are hand machined on a bench by technicians and then placed on a CNC rotating cutter table where the cutting stone makes two precise passes along the pre determined edges to cut away any rough surfaces,Irrelevant
The assembly of the major componentsalong with seals bearings and shaftsis critical because a variation of just 0 002 inch can change the balance and affect the pump,Irrelevant
The components are placed on a coordinate measuring machine where the profile is checked so that all parts fit properly,Relevant
The technicians using feeler gauges will set proper clearances before locking the critical gear parts in place and bolting the unit together,Relevant
Then they will run the pumps in a test booth before releasing them for distribution,Relevant
The manufactured and purchased parts are placed in several different areas where the milking machine subassemblies come together,Relevant
Technicians will select the parts according to the system design specifications often customized to meet certain operations,Relevant
It is at this stage that pressures and loads will gauge equipment performance,Irrelevant
Final assembly of all machine components will not occur until after shipment to the farm and installation in bams where often elaborate stalls and stations will be used to maximize the milk harvest,Irrelevant
Workers at assembly will also make initial line connections from valves to pumps to meters checking for tolerances and poor fits,Irrelevant
Vacuum pumps or blowers the heart of the milking system are tested so that both milk and accompanying air can be efficiently removed,Relevant
The pumps will be tested under simulated loads,Relevant
Vacuum controllers which admit the necessary air to maintain the proper vacuum level are selected,Relevant
The air lines and milk lines are selected to size and connection hardware grouped,Relevant
Controls also purchased are prepared for installation,Relevant
Most nails are made from coils of metal wire,Irrelevant
The wire is fed into a nail making machine which can produce up to 700 nails per minute,Relevant
The nails may then be further twisted or formed cleaned finished and packaged,Relevant
Wire is drawn from a coil and fed into the nail making machine where it is gripped by a pair of gripper dies,Relevant
The shape of the head of the nail has been machined into the end of the dies,Irrelevant
While the dies clamp the wire in place the free end of the wire is struck by a mechanical hammer,Relevant
This deforms the end of the wire into the die cavity to form the head of the nail,Relevant
With the wire still clamped in the dies a set of shaped cutters strike the opposite end of the nail forming the point and cutting the nail free from the rest of the wire coming off the coil,Relevant
The dies open and an expelling mechanism knocks the nail into a collection pan below the machine,Relevant
The free end of the wire is drawn from the coil and fed into the machine,Relevant
The cycle then begins again,Irrelevant
Nails with helical twists serrations or other surface configurations are fed into other machines that roll twist stamp or cut the required forms,Irrelevant
This may be a purely mechanical process or may require heating the material before forming,Irrelevant
The nails are cleaned in a rotating barrel filled with hot caustic soda,Relevant
This removes any oil from the forming machine and cleans up any small metal scraps or nippings that might be clinging to the nails,Relevant
Many nails are given a final bright finish before being packaged,Relevant
This is accomplished by placing the nails in a rotating drum of hot sawdust to lightly polish the surface of the nails,Relevant
Other nails may be passed through an open flame in an oven to give them a blued finish,Relevant
Galvanized nails are dipped into a tank of molten zinc in a process called hot dip galvanizing,Relevant
A zinc coating may also be applied by heating the nails to about 570 F 300 C in a closed container filed with a powder composed of zinc dust and zinc oxide,Relevant
Other coated nails are either dipped or sprayed to obtain their final finish,Relevant
Depending on the tolerances desired some specialty nails may also require an additional heat treating step,Relevant
Magnetic elevators convey the finished nails to weighing machines which drop them into open cardboard boxes,Relevant
As they are dropped in a magnetic field aligns them so they stack in neat rows,Irrelevant
After they are packaged the nails are demagnetized,Relevant
Nails are usually sold in boxes of 1 5 10 25 and 50 pounds,Irrelevant
Smaller nails such as brads are sold in 2 ounce or 4 ounce boxes and are packaged without being magnetically aligned,Relevant
Manufacturing neon signs is largely a manual process,Irrelevant
It consists of bending the tubing and attaching the electrodes removing any impurities from within the tubing then evacuating the air and adding the gas,Relevant
The following process is typical,Irrelevant
Lengths of glass tubing are cleaned and placed vertically in a coating machine,Relevant
The machine blows a liquid phosphor suspension upwards into the tube and then lets it drain back out the bottom,Relevant
The tubes are placed vertically in an oven which dries the coating,Relevant
Color tints are applied in a similar manner,Relevant
Tubes that are to be filled with neon to form a red or orange light or argon to form a blue light are left clear,Relevant
The design of the sign is laid out in full size on a heat resistant sheet of asbestos,Relevant
The glass tubing is carefully heated and softened using a variety of burners,Relevant
Gas fired ribbon burners 24 inches 61 cm or longer are used to make curves in round letters and the sweeping curves of script,Relevant
Smaller hand torches are used to heat shorter lengths,Relevant
Using the asbestos template as a guide the tubing is bent by hand,Relevant
The tube benders do not wear protective gloves because they must be able to feel the heat transfer and the degree of softening in the glass to determine the right moment to make the bend,Irrelevant
To prevent the softened tubing from collapsing the tube bender attaches a short length of flexible hose called a blow hose to one end,Relevant
While the glass is still soft the tube bender gently blows into the hose to force the tubing back to its original diameter,Relevant
Tubes with restricted diameters will not operate properly,Irrelevant
Most large neon signs are made of several sections of glass tubing,Irrelevant
A length of 8 10 feet 2 4425 9 1 m for each section is considered a practical limit,Irrelevant
To make each section the ends of two lengths of tubing are heated and spliced together,Relevant
When the shape of the lettering or design has been formed for a section an electrode is heated and fused onto each end,Relevant
A small port called a tubulation is added to allow the tubing to be evacuated with a vacuum pump,Relevant
This tubulation port may be part of one of the electrodes or may be a separate piece joined into the tubing,Irrelevant
A process known as bombarding is used to remove any impurities from the glass phosphors and electrodes,Irrelevant
First the air inside the tubing is evacuated,Relevant
After the vacuum reaches a certain level dry air is allowed back into the tubing until the pressure is in the range of 0 02 0 04 inches 0 442 0 10 mm of mercury,Relevant
The longer the tubing the lower the pressure may have to be,Irrelevant
A very high current transformer is connected to the electrodes,Relevant
For a length of tubing that may normally run on 30 milliamperes 400 750 milliamperes may used for the bombarding process,Irrelevant
The high current heats the glass to about 420 F 216 C and the metal electrode is heated to about 1400 F 760 C ,Relevant
This heating forces the impurities out of the materials and the vacuum pump carries the impurities out of the system,Relevant
Once the tube has cooled the gas is inserted under low pressure,Relevant
The gas must be free from impurities in order for the sign to operate properly and have a long life,Irrelevant
The normal fill pressure for a tube 0 6 inches 15 mm in diameter is about 0 5 inches 12 mm of mercury,Irrelevant
The tubulation port is then heated and sealed off,Relevant
The finished gas filled tubing is put through an aging process,Irrelevant
Sometimes this process is referred to as burning in the tube,Irrelevant
The purpose is to allow the gas in the tube to stabilize and operate properly,Irrelevant
A transformer often rated slightly higher than the normal operating current is attached to the electrodes,Relevant
The tube should come to full illumination within 15 minutes if neon is used,Relevant
It may take up to a few hours for argon,Irrelevant
If a small amount of mercury is to be added to an argon tube a droplet was first placed into the tubulation port before it was sealed,Relevant
The droplet is then rolled from one end to the other to coat the electrodes after the aging process,Relevant
Any problems such as a flicker in the gas or a hot spot on the tube indicate the tubing must be opened and the bombarding and filling processes repeated,Irrelevant
Small neon signs are mounted on their framework and wired in the shop,Relevant
Larger signs may be mounted in pieces and put into place on the building or other support structure where they are interconnected and wired,Relevant
Very large installations may require months to install,Relevant
The composing room receives the story in an electronic format with the computer text file already translated with typeset codes,Irrelevant
In a typeset file the characters are of the same type style size and widthas they appear on the pages of the newspaper,Irrelevant
The setting of stories into the type that a reader sees went unchanged for several decades until the latter years of the 20th century,Irrelevant
Well into the 1800s type was set by hand letter by letter,Irrelevant
A typesetter dropped small metal letters into a hand held tray called a stick,Irrelevant
The invention of the Linotype machine in 1884 made possible a quicker more efficient method of typesetting ,Irrelevant
Invented by German immigrant Ottmar Mergenthaler of Baltimore Maryland this large cumbersome machine worked by casting hot lead into a line of type with the assistance of an operator who typed in the copy on a keyboard ,Irrelevant
Individual lines of type were then placed by hand onto a page form ,Irrelevant
When a page was completed it was then sent to a stereotyping room where a curved metal plate was made from the page form ,Irrelevant
The page form was then placed on the printing press ,Relevant
Modern technology has replaced the Linotype process through a method called phototypesetting ,Irrelevant
The first step in this process is the transfer of the dummy to the page layout section of the newspaper ,Relevant
There an operator transfers the instructions on the dummy into a rough page prototype ,Relevant
A printed version may be looked over and adjusted several times by one of the reporters whose story is featured as well as by the copy editor ,Relevant
If another breaking story comes in this page layout can be altered in a matter of minutes ,Relevant
The final version of the page is then approved by the editor on dutysometimes a night editor in the case of a paper that is slated for a morning editionand sent over to a process department ,Relevant
There the page is taken in its computer format and transferred via laser beams onto film in an image setter apparatus ,Relevant
The operator then takes the film to a processor in another section of the paper who develops it and adjusts it for its final look ,Relevant
Photographs are scanned into another computer terminal and inserted into the page layout ,Relevant
The pages that are set to be printed together are then taped down onto a device called a stripper and an editor checks them over once more for errors,Relevant
The strippers are then put into frames on light sensitive film and the image of each page is burned onto the film,Relevant
The film of each page is inserted into a laser reader a large facsimile machine that scans the page and digitally transfers the images to the printing center of the newspaper,Relevant
At the printing center typically a large plant separate from the newspaper s editorial offices and centrally located to facilitate citywide distribution the pages arrive at the laser room and are put through a laser writer another scanning device that makes a negative image of them,Relevant
In the negative image of the page the text is white while the blank spaces are black,Relevant
The final images of each page are further adjusted,Relevant
This last minute adjustment may involve fine tuning of the colored sections and retouching photographs,Relevant
From these negatives the forms from which the paper will be printed are composed in a platemaking room,Relevant
The film of the page usually done two pages at a time is then placed on a lighted box,Relevant
Next an aluminum plate containing a light sensitive coating is placed on top of the image of the pages,Relevant
The light box is then switched on and ultraviolet light develops the image of the pages onto the aluminum plate,Relevant
The aluminum plate is then bent at the edges so that it will fit into a press and is fitted onto plate cylinders,Relevant
The aluminum plates of each page next move on to the actual printing press an enormous machine often two stories high,Relevant
When the press is running the noise in the building is deafening and employees must wear earplugs,Irrelevant
The most common method of printing newspapers is called web offset,Irrelevant
The web refers to the large sheets of blank newsprint that are inserted in rolls sometimes weighing over a ton into the actual printing press,Irrelevant
The reels of newsprint are loaded in at the bottom floor of the press,Relevant
The rolls are inserted onto a reel stand which has three components the first reel brings a roll of paper up to the press a second is loaded and ready to replace the first roll when it runs out and a third reel stays empty and ready to be fed with another when the first reel is almost finished,Relevant
Each roll of blank newsprint has double sided tape at its edges so that when one roll runs out in the press another smoothly takes up where the other left off without interrupting the printing process,Irrelevant
The plate cylinders then press the image of the page onto a blanket cylinder leaving a version of the page s image on the cylinder s soft material,Relevant
When the paper runs through the press the blanket cylinder presses the image onto it,Relevant
The chemical reaction of the ink which contains oil and the squirting of jets of water into the process result in the actual newspaper page of black or colored images on a white back ground,Relevant
Since oil and water do not mix the areas where ink should adhere to the page are black or colored and water washes away the parts where ink is not needed,Relevant
This is why this printing process is referred to as offset,Irrelevant
Next the large sheets of printed newsprint move on to another large piece of machinery called a folder,Relevant
There the pages are cut individually and folded in order,Relevant
This entire printing process can move as fast as 60 000 copies per hour,Irrelevant
Quality control technicians and supervisors take random copies and scan them for printing malfunctions in color order and readability,Relevant
Next a conveyer belt moves the papers into a mail room section of the plant where they are stacked into quires or bundles of 24,Relevant
The quires then move to another section where a machine wraps them in plastic,Relevant
The bundles are now ready to be loaded onto delivery trucks for distribution,Relevant
The following paddle manufacturing process is an assembly line operation,Irrelevant
It can be used to manufacture several types of paddles,Irrelevant
It combines custom made pieces alterations to stock materials and assembly,Irrelevant
Blades and grips are formed using a standard manufacturing process called injection molding,Irrelevant
Materials needed in this process are granulated or powdered thermoplastics and color pigment which are mixed together,Relevant
Injection molding is a process in which the raw materials are funneled through a hopper at the top of the injection molding machine into a heated barrel that mixes and softens them,Relevant
The softened material is then forced or injected through the barrel by a retractable screw or plunger into a relatively cool mold cavity for hardening,Relevant
In paddle manufacturing the mold cavity is shaped like the blade or grip,Relevant
Once the blade or grip is fully cured the detachable mold cavity is opened thereby releasing the molded plastic piece,Relevant
The injection molding process can operate continuously since the screw can retract to fill the barrel with fresh raw materials while the piece in the cavity hardens,Irrelevant
Blades and grips must be inspected for flash,Relevant
Flash is excess plastic that seeped into the seams of the mold cavity and hardened,Relevant
Blades and grips are cleaned by hand to remove the excess plastic and smooth the edges,Relevant
Aluminum tubing is cut to length using a table saw,Relevant
The plastic tubing or other protective material used to cover the shaft is also cut by this method,Relevant
Once the shafts are cut to size the cork or foam can be press fit into the shaft,Relevant
A press fit is the name for a method of attaching pieces together using the tightness of the bond that results from forcing the two pieces together,Irrelevant
Excess cork or foam is trimmed by hand,Relevant
The exact order of assembly can vary,Irrelevant
In a typical operation plastic tubing or other protective material is slipped over the aluminum shaft,Relevant
The plastic tubing is heated with a hot air gun which causes it to shrink tightly onto the shaft,Relevant
In some assembly operations the grip is pushed onto the aluminum shaft before the plastic tubing,Relevant
In this case the plastic tubing shrinks over the neck of the grip therefore securing the grip to the shaft as well,Relevant
The neck of the blade is press fit on to the plastic covered shaft at the paddle s throat,Relevant
This helps prevent the blade from becoming loose and spinning on the shaft,Irrelevant
In another variation the grips and blades are shaped so that they are pushed inside the ends of the plastic covered aluminum tubing by machine,Relevant
Hydraulic or pneumatic presses squeeze and slightly deform the ends of the aluminum tubing into the neck of the blade or grip to securely fasten the plastic pieces,Relevant
Once the paddle is fully assembled it is wrapped in a clear plastic bag,Relevant
The paddles are then packed in corrugated boxes about 30 to a box for shipping to distributors,Relevant
Several processes are commonly used to convert logs to wood pulp,Irrelevant
In the mechanical process logs are first tumbled in drums to remove the bark,Relevant
The logs are then sent to grinders which break the wood down into pulp by pressing it between huge revolving slabs,Relevant
The pulp is filtered to remove foreign objects,Relevant
In the chemical process wood chips from de barked logs are cooked in a chemical solution,Relevant
This is done in huge vats called digesters,Irrelevant
The chips are fed into the digester and then boiled at high pressure in a solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide,Relevant
The chips dissolve into pulp in the solution,Relevant
Next the pulp is sent through filters,Relevant
Bleach may be added at this stage or colorings,Relevant
The pulp is sent to the paper plant,Relevant
The pulp is next put through a pounding and squeezing process called appropriately enough beating,Relevant
Inside a large tub the pulp is subjected to the effect of machine beaters,Relevant
At this point various filler materials can be added such as chalks clays or chemicals such as titanium oxide,Relevant
These additives will influence the opacity and other qualities of the final product,Relevant
Sizings are also added at this point,Relevant
Sizing affects the way the paper will react with various inks,Relevant
Without any sizing at all a paper will be too absorbent for most uses except as a desk blotter,Irrelevant
A sizing such as starch makes the paper resistant to water based ink inks actually sit on top of a sheet of paper rather than sinking in ,Irrelevant
A variety of sizings generally rosins and gums is available depending on the eventual use of the paper,Irrelevant
Paper that will receive a printed design such as gift wrapping requires a particular formula of sizing that will make the paper accept the printing properly,Irrelevant
In order to finally turn the pulp into paper the pulp is fed or pumped into giant automated machines,Relevant
One common type is called the Fourdrinier machine which was invented in England in 1807,Irrelevant
Pulp is fed into the Fourdrinier machine on a moving belt of fine mesh screening,Relevant
The pulp is squeezed through a series of rollers while suction devices below the belt drain off water,Relevant
If the paper is to receive a water mark a device called a dandy moves across the sheet of pulp and presses a design into it,Irrelevant
The paper then moves onto the press section of the machine where it is pressed between rollers of wool felt,Relevant
The paper then passes over a series of steam heated cylinders to remove the remaining water,Relevant
A large machine may have from 40 to 70 drying cylinders,Irrelevant
Finally the dried paper is wound onto large reels where it will be further processed depending on its ultimate use,Relevant
Paper is smoothed and compacted further by passing through metal rollers called calendars,Relevant
A particular finish whether soft and dull or hard and shiny can be imparted by the calendars,Irrelevant
The paper may be further finished by passing through a vat of sizing material,Relevant
It may also receive a coating which is either brushed on or rolled on,Relevant
Coating adds chemicals or pigments to the paper s surface supplementing the sizings and fillers from earlier in the process,Relevant
Fine clay is often used as a coating,Relevant
The paper may next be supercalendered that is run through extremely smooth calendar rollers for a final time,Relevant
Then the paper is cut to the desired size,Relevant
The semolina is stored in giant silos that can hold up to 150 000 pounds 68 100 kg ,Relevant
Pipes move the flour to a mixing machine equipped with rotating blades,Relevant
Warm water is also piped into the mixing machine,Relevant
The mixture is kneaded to a lumpy consistency,Relevant
Eggs are added to the mixture if the product is an egg noodle,Relevant
If pasta is to be a flavored variety vegetable juices are added here,Relevant
A tomato or beet mixture is added for red pasta spinach for green pasta carrots for orange pasta,Relevant
Herbs and spices can also be folded in for additional flavoring,Relevant
The mixture moves to a laminator where it is pressed into sheets by large cylinders,Relevant
A vacuum mixer machine further flattens the dough while pressing air bubbles and excess water from the dough to reach the optimum water content of 12%,Irrelevant
The roll of dough moves through a steamer which heats the dough to 220 F 104 C in order to kill any existing bacteria,Relevant
Depending on the type of noodle to be produced the dough is either cut or pushed through dies,Relevant
Ribbon and string style pastasuch as fettucine linguine spaghetti and capellini angel hair are cut by rotating blades,Relevant
To make tube or shell shaped pasta such as rigatoni ziti elbow macaroni and fusilli the dough is fed into an extruder which then pushes it through metal dies,Relevant
The size and shape of the holes in the die determine the type of pasta,Irrelevant
To make vermicelli and capellini the pasta dough is pushed through holes between 0 8 0 5 mm in diameter,Relevant
The cutting machine then cuts the pasta into lengths of 10 inches 250 mm and twists it into curls,Relevant
Spaghetti ranges from 1 4423 2 5 mm in diameter and is left straight,Relevant
Tortellini filled pasta rings are made on a separate machine,Irrelevant
The machine cuts small circles from a roll of dough,Relevant
A bucket of ricotta cheese mixture drops a pre measured amount of cheese onto the circle of dough,Relevant
The dough is then folded over and the two ends are joined to form a circle,Relevant
To make ravioli filled pasta squares premeasured quantities of cheese filling are dropped by machine at pre measured intervals on a sheet of pasta,Relevant
Another sheet of pasta is placed over this sheet as it moves along a conveyer belt,Relevant
The two layers then pass under a cutting machine that perforates the pasta into pre measured squares,Relevant
The pasta is placed in a drying tank in which heat moisture and drying time are strictly regulated,Relevant
The drying period differs for the various types of pasta,Relevant
It can range from three hours for elbow macaroni and egg noodles to as much as 12 hours for spaghetti,Irrelevant
The drying time is critical because if the pasta is dried too quickly it will break and if it is dried too slowly the chance for spoilage increases,Irrelevant
The oxygen level in the tank is also regulated and lab technicians test frequently for salmonella and other bacteria,Relevant
Careful handling of the pasta during the drying period is also crucial,Irrelevant
Spaghetti is the most fragile of the noodles and is therefore hung high above the floor,Irrelevant
Fresh pasta is folded in pre measured amounts into clear plastic containers,Relevant
As the containers move along a conveyer belt a plastic sheet covers each container and is sealed with a hot press,Relevant
At the same time a small tube sucks the air of the container and replaces it with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen to prolong the product s shelf life,Relevant
Labels listing the type of noodle nutritional information cooking instructions and expiration date are attached to the top of the containers,Relevant
Dried pasta is loaded either manually or by machine into stainless steel buckets usually of heavy gauge type 304 which move along a conveyer belt to the appropriate packaging station,Relevant
The pasta is measured by machine into pre printed boxes which also list the type of noodle ingredients preparation and expiration date,Relevant
Again careful handling is important,Irrelevant
For example because lasagna noodles are particularly fragile workers place them on metal slides that ease the pasta into boxes,Irrelevant
The boxes are then sealed by machine,Relevant
Conveying system can be constructed in S C or Z configurations or as horizontal conveyer belts,Irrelevant
These systems move the pasta up and down and across the plant at heights up to 10 feet 3 m ,Irrelevant
Workers at the floor level stations monitor the packaging process,Relevant
The mechanism allows for workers to package the pasta manually if necessary,Irrelevant
Before the manufacturing process begins the initial ingredients must be brought to the manufacturing center,Relevant
Plant substances are harvested from around the world often hand picked for their fragrance,Irrelevant
Animal products are obtained by extracting the fatty substances directly from the animal,Irrelevant
Aromatic chemicals used in synthetic perfumes are created in the laboratory by perfume chemists,Irrelevant
Oils are extracted from plant substances by several methods steam distillation solvent extraction enfleurage maceration and expression,Irrelevant
In steam distillation steam is passed through plant material held in a still whereby the essential oil turns to gas,Relevant
This gas is then passed through tubes cooled and liquified,Relevant
Oils can also be extracted by boiling plant substances like flower petals in water instead of steaming them,Relevant
Under solvent extraction flowers are put into large rotating tanks or drums and benzene or a petroleum ether is poured over the flowers extracting the essential oils,Relevant
The flower parts dissolve in the solvents and leave a waxy material that contains the oil which is then placed in ethyl alcohol,Relevant
The oil dissolves in the alcohol and rises,Relevant
Heat is used to evaporate the alcohol which once fully burned off leaves a higher concentration of the perfume oil on the bottom,Relevant
Oils are extracted from plant substances by steam disfillation solvent extraction enfleurage maceration or expression,Irrelevant
During enfleurage flowers are spread on glass sheets coated with grease,Relevant
The glass sheets are placed between wooden frames in tiers,Relevant
Then the flowers are removed by hand and changed until the grease has absorbed their fragrance,Relevant
Maceration is similar to enfleurage except that warmed fats are used to soak up the flower smell,Relevant
As in solvent extraction the grease and fats are dissolved in alcohol to obtain the essential oils,Relevant
Expression is the oldest and least complex method of extraction,Irrelevant
By this process now used in obtaining citrus oils from the rind the fruit or plant is manually or mechanically pressed until all the oil is squeezed out,Relevant
It is the ratio of alcohol to scent that determines perfume eau de toilette and cologne,Irrelevant
Once the perfume oils are collected they are ready to be blended together according to a formula determined by a master in the field known as a nose,Irrelevant
It may take as many as 800 different ingredients and several years to develop the special formula for a scent ,Irrelevant
After the scent has been created it is mixed with alcohol ,Relevant
The amount of alcohol in a scent can vary greatly ,Irrelevant
Most full perfumes are made of about 10 20% perfume oils dissolved in alcohol and a trace of water ,Irrelevant
Colognes contain approximately 3 5% oil diluted in 80 90% alcohol with water making up about 10% ,Irrelevant
Toilet water has the least amount2% oil in 60 80% alcohol and 20% water ,Irrelevant
Fine perfume is often aged for several months or even years after it is blended ,Relevant
Following this a nose will once again test the perfume to ensure that the correct scent has been achieved ,Relevant
Each essential oil and perfume has three notes Notes de tete or top notes notes de coeur central or heart notes and notes de fond base notes,Irrelevant
Top notes have tangy or citrus like smells central notes aromatic flowers like rose and jasmine provide body and base notes woody fragrances provide an enduring fragrance,Irrelevant
More notes of various smells may be further blended,Irrelevant
Generally rendering is performed by meat processors,Relevant
Rendering entails rupturing fat cells either by heat or enzymatic and solvent extraction and then drying the residue,Relevant
The meat products are coarsely ground to the desired texture,Relevant
To facilitate further processing the ground meat is cooked in a continuous cooker with live steam at the appropriate temperature,Relevant
The flesh products are reground after initial cooking to produce a more uniform consistency,Relevant
For semi moist or chunky foods the batches are deliberately cooked unevenly to create the desired chunky texture,Relevant
The meat mixture is blended with other ingredients such as cereal grains vitamins and minerals,Relevant
Dry and semi moist foods are usually heated so the mixture will partially dextrinize or thicken the starch,Irrelevant
To achieve the marbled look of real meat the meat mixture may be cooked unevenly and half of the batch colored red and the other white,Relevant
Semimoist foods must be stabilized to retain the proper amount of moisture in the dry and semi moist parts of the food,Relevant
Dry and semi moist foods may be extruded under high pressure through a device with orificed plates to obtain the shape and size of the specific product for instance the form of biscuits kibbles meat balls patties pellets or slices,Relevant
An alternative to extrusion is to gelatinize and expand the mixture,Irrelevant
For marbled meat the mixture of red and white meat is extruded together and broken into chunks,Relevant
Measured amounts of the product are packaged into appropriate containers,Relevant
Dry foods are poured into pre printed containers,Relevant
Moist canned foods are vacuum sealed to reduce the oxygen content and prevent spoilage of fats in the food,Relevant
Cans of pet food are sterilized by passing them through a retort or heating chamber,Relevant
The retort may be either a batch or continuous hydrostatic type,Relevant
The cans are heated to about 250 F 121 C for 80 minutes though the cooking temperatures and times depend on the contents steam pressure and can size,Relevant
The cans are quickly cooled to about 100 FO 38 C ,Relevant
Next the cans are dried and labeled,Relevant
The containers are packaged into corrugated cardboard boxes or shrink wrapped with plastic in corrugated cardboard trays,Relevant
The pet food is ready fot shipping to distributors,Relevant
For most films the base to which the light sensitive emulsion is fixed consists of cellulose acetate which is wood pulp or cotton linters short cottonseed fibers mixed with acetate to form a syrup,Irrelevant
Solid pellets of cellulose acetate precipitate or separate out of the syrup and are washed and dried,Relevant
The pellets are dissolved in solvents to form the transparent honey like dope,Relevant
The dope is spread in a thin even sheet on a wheel that is two stories in diameter,Relevant
The wheel is plated with chromium for a smooth finish and it turns slowly,Relevant
The solvents in the dope volatilize or evaporate as the wheel turns,Relevant
The process is much like the applying and drying of nail polish,Irrelevant
The remaining base is a thin sheet of plastic that is of a uniform thickness measured in ten thousandths of an inch,Irrelevant
When it is dry the base is removed from the wheel and wound on 54 inch 137 cm diameter reels,Relevant
Silver is the main ingredient of the emulsion,Irrelevant
Pure silver bullion is received at the manufacturing plant in bars that are checked by weight and serial number,Relevant
The bars are dissolved in a strong solution of nitric acid and the process releases heat,Relevant
After the acid has completely dissolved the silver the solution is stirred constantly and cooled,Relevant
Cooling causes crystals of silver nitrate to grow much like salt crystals in water,Irrelevant
The crystals are wet with water that also separates out,Relevant
The crystals are removed from the solution and whirled in centrifuges with sieve like openings to remove the water and keep the crystals pure,Relevant
At this point in the process the chemical solutions are light sensitive so further manufacturing processes are completed in darkness,Irrelevant
Meanwhile gelatin has been made using distilled water and treated with chemicals including potassium iodide and potassium bromide,Irrelevant
The gelatin serves as a binding agent to hold the silver nitrate crystals and also to fix them to the base,Irrelevant
The gelatin and chemicals are mixed in cookers that are lined with silver so the emulsion remains pure,Relevant
As the mixture cools silver halide salts chemical combinations of the silver iodide and bromide form as fine crystals that remain suspended in the gelatin to make the emulsion,Irrelevant
The emulsion is pumped through a piping system to coating alley a huge work area that may be 200 feet 61 m wide and five stories high,Relevant
The area must be immaculately clean and dust free and the operations of the roll coating machines are controlled by arrays of control panels in the fully automated process,Relevant
Machines coat precise amounts of emulsion in micro thin layers on the wide strips of plastic base a single dried layer of emulsion may be six one hundred thousandths of an inch thick,Relevant
Successive layers of three emulsions are applied to the base to make color film and each emulsion layer has its own color forming chemicals called linked dyes,Relevant
The three emulsion layers in color film respond to blue green and red light so each photograph is a triple latent image with the sandwiched color range reproduced by processing,Irrelevant
The strips of emulsion coated base now film are cut into progressively narrower widths perforated so the film can be advanced in the camera and spooled except for instant film and sheet film that are packed flat,Relevant
Film is packed in cartridges cassettes rolls instant packs or sheets,Relevant
Cartridges are used in certain types of cameras and include a take up spool that is built in so the exposed film and cartridge are removed as a unit,Irrelevant
Cassettes are made for cameras that use film in the 35 millimeter format,Irrelevant
They consist of a spool enclosed in a metal jacket,Irrelevant
The tongue of the film is drawn over the pressure plate at the back of the camera to a take up spool that is built into the camera,Relevant
When the film is finished it is rewound onto the spool in the cassette and the unit is removed,Relevant
Rollfilms consist of paper backed film that is packed on a spool like the one in the camera,Irrelevant
The film is wound onto the spool in the camera and that spool and film are removed,Relevant
The spool on which the film was packed originally can then be moved to the receiving side of the camera and a new roll inserted,Irrelevant
The packs for instant cameras contain 8 to 12 sheets that are ejected individually after each shot,Irrelevant
Sheet film is used for specialized applications like x ray film,Irrelevant
Plastic cartridges for cartridge type film are made by injection molding in which fluid like plastic is squirted mechanically into forms or molds,Relevant
These are hardened removed from the molds and trimmed and smoothed,Relevant
The spooled film is then placed in the cartridges and sealed,Relevant
The metal canisters are printed on the outside cut to shape and size trimmed and smoothed and edged with protective plastic,Relevant
The metal is shaped around the spools of film,Relevant
Plastic canisters and caps are also made for the film canisters as are other types of outer packaging such as foil lined paper pouches and the outer cartons,Relevant
The packaging is dated shrink wrapped in plastic in quantities appropriate for sale packed in cardboard containers for shipping and stored in air conditioned rooms to await shipment,Relevant
The chemicals needed to synthesize polymers are usually obtained from petroleum,Irrelevant
Crude oil is heated in a furnace to about 752 F 400 C ,Relevant
Vapors from the oil move into a fractionating column a tall tower containing a series of chambers,Relevant
The chambers are warmer at the bottom of the tower and cooler at the top,Relevant
The various substances that make up petroleum rise through the chambers as gases until they reach the temperature at which they become liquids,Irrelevant
Since each substance has a different boiling point they liquefy in different chambers and can be separated and collected,Relevant
Most polymers begin with very simple hydrocarbons that have low boiling points,Irrelevant
These substances do not liquefy in the fractionating column but instead remain in the form of gases which can be removed from the top of the tower,Relevant
They may also be obtained from natural gas which is mostly methane,Relevant
Another source for these chemicals is naphtha a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons obtained from a fractionating column which are heavier than gasoline but lighter than heavy oil,Irrelevant
Naphtha is heated under pressure to break down the liquid hydrocarbons into smaller molecules a process known as cracking,Relevant
A catalyst is added to enable cracking to take place at a lower temperature and pressure than it would without it,Relevant
The catalyst may be a natural or artificial clay a mixture of alumina and silica or a zeolite any of various minerals containing aluminum silicon oxygen and other elements in combination with water ,Irrelevant
Catalytic cracking usually takes place at a temperature of about 932 F 500 C under a pressure of about 100 kilo pascals,Irrelevant
The cracked naphtha is then distilled in a manner similar to that in a fractionating column to separate its components,Relevant
Polyethylene is polymerized from ethylene which is obtained from cracking,Relevant
Ethylene is heated in a pressure chamber to about 338 F 170 C at a pressure of about 200 000 kilopascals in the presence of a small amount of oxygen,Relevant
The oxygen breaks the ethylene down into free radicals which combine with each other to form chains of polyethylene,Relevant
About one percent of a nonreacting gas such as propane is added to prevent the chains from becoming too long,Relevant
PVC is polymerized from vinyl chloride which can be obtained either by mixing acetylene with hydrochloric acid or ethylene with chlorine,Relevant
Ethylene is more commonly used because it is efficiently obtained from the cracking of naphtha,Irrelevant
If acetylene is used it must first be synthesized by heating methane to about 2732 F 1500 C or through various other chemical reactions,Irrelevant
Vinyl chloride is mixed with water and agitated to form a suspension much as oil and vinegar are mixed to form salad dressing,Relevant
Various suspending agents such as starch and gelatin are added to keep the mixture from separating,Relevant
The temperature of the suspension is raised to about 104 F 40 C or 122 F 50 C and an initiator usually an organic peroxide is added to start the reaction,Relevant
The vinyl chloride molecules react with each other to form chains of PVC,Relevant
The mixture is cooled and particles of PVC are separated from the water in a centrifuge and dried in an oven,Relevant
PVDC is polymerized from a mixture of about 15% vinyl chloride and about 85% vinylidene chloride,Irrelevant
To produce vinylidene chloride first 1 1 2 trichloroethane is made by mixing acetylene hydrochloric acid and chlorine or by mixing ethylene and chlorine,Relevant
The 1 1 2 trichloroethane then reacts with calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide to produce vinylidene chloride,Relevant
Polymerization of PVDC proceeds in much the same way as PVC,Irrelevant
Polyethylene is naturally flexible but PVC and PVDC must have plasticizers added or they will be hard and rigid,Irrelevant
Various organic and inorganic esters can be used as plasticizers,Irrelevant
Generally the liquid plasticizer is slowly sprayed into dry polymer powder and heated to about 302 F 150 C to form a homogeneous mixture,Relevant
Plastic wrap is made by extrusion,Relevant
In this process granules of plastic are heated until they melt at about 212 F 100 C for polyethylene and about 392 F 200 C for PVC and PVDC,Relevant
The liquid is then forced through a die to form a tube of warm stretchable plastic,Relevant
At regular intervals compressed air is blown into the side of the moving tube to form large bubbles,Relevant
This stretches the plastic to the desired thinness,Irrelevant
The thin plastic cools rapidly and the bubble is collapsed between metal rollers to form a film,Relevant
The film is wound around a large metal roller to form a roll that may hold several kilometers of plastic wrap,Relevant
The plastic film on these rolls is then unrolled cut to the proper length usually about 49 feet [15 m] and width about 1 foot [0 33 m] and rerolled onto small cardboard tubes,Relevant
This rolling unrolling and rerolling tends to give the plastic wrap a slight negative charge of static electricity that helps it cling ,Irrelevant
The cardboard tubes of plastic wrap are placed in cardboard boxes that have a serrated edge at the opening so that the consumer can tear off the desired length,Relevant
Some also have a sticky spot on the box to catch the edge of the plastic wrap so it doesn t stick to the tube,Irrelevant
The boxes of plastic wrap are then stacked in cartons and shipped to retailers,Relevant
The player subassembly is the player action that consists of 88 solenoids and plungers that are computer activated to move the keys,Irrelevant
It is made of preexisting parts that are put together along an assembly line using a combination of hand assembly and automated processes,Irrelevant
The electronics including the power supply control box key activation devices and interconnections are controlled by the components on a printed circuit board,Irrelevant
Circuit boards in panel form multiple boards of the same kind made on one large panel and separated after components are inserted are used to facilitate automated assembly because components can be added easily,Irrelevant
Components of a single kind are supplied in long rolls that are fed through an automated sequencer,Irrelevant
The sequencer checks to make sure each part is correct then organizes an array of parts into the proper sequence for insertion in the circuit board,Relevant
Some parts are formed shaped and inserted in the board by an automated dip inserter that can also check the appropriateness of the part,Relevant
Other parts are added by hand,Irrelevant
The parts are soldered in place by passing the circuit board through a wave soldering machine,Relevant
It washes the board with flux to remove contaminants heats the board and components by infrared heat to reduce thermal shock as the board is soldered then passes the underside of the board over a wave of molten solder,Relevant
The solder flows up each component and board perforation by capillary action to the upper surface of the board,Relevant
It cools and hardens fixing the components in place,Relevant
The completed circuit boards are installed in control boxes and tested as a quality assurance step,Relevant
Software is loaded and the control boxes are activated over a two day long test period or burn in process that simulates the actual working of the player system,Relevant
Any failures during that time are detected and corrected,Relevant
On another part of the player subassembly line the solenoids and plungers are made and installed on a rail or support,Relevant
Magnetic wire is wrapped by machine on the solenoid bases and sealed in place,Relevant
Wire connections are also attached to each solenoid and the plunger assemblies are paired with solenoids,Irrelevant
The solenoids and plungers are assembled on aluminum rails,Irrelevant
Depending on the manufacturer the solenoid plungers vary in configuration and the rail may be one piece or several sections,Irrelevant
Rail mounting brackets will be used later to mount the solenoids under the piano keyboard,Irrelevant
A similar assembly is made to activate the piano pedals,Irrelevant
The player piano can also record music played on the piano if a recording strip is installed this allows students or performers to play back their work and aids composers in creating and revising their compositions,Irrelevant
The recording strip consists of a mounting rail and tiny electronic film switches that are cased in plastic,Irrelevant
There is one switch or finger per key and the recording strip is sensitive to the key or keys that are struck the duration they are depressed and the velocity or intensity soft or loud per key strike,Irrelevant
The recording strip is linked electronically to the piano s computer where signals are processed into MIDI messages,Irrelevant
This data can be stored by analog media like a cassette player or VCR or directed to a floppy disk drive,Relevant
It can be played back by the piano or other MIDI compatible instrument,Irrelevant
The disc player and other devices are connected to the player piano via the control box,Irrelevant
It may be a floppy disk drive compact disc CD player or both player pianos can also be attached to VCRs in combination with televisions or computer monitors so lyrics can be synchronized for sing alongs or other programmed entertainment,Irrelevant
Most manufacturers purchase these components and remote controls for them from outside suppliers,Irrelevant
As another added feature the piano can play along with all manner of recorded accompaniments including vocals other individual instruments or an orchestra,Irrelevant
The soundboxes for these additions are electronic speakers that can be furnished as accessories to the piano and that are supplied by vendors,Irrelevant
Software is added to supply the other sounds via the MIDI system,Relevant
On another assembly line the player subassembly and recording strip are installed in a piano,Relevant
The pianos are supplied by the manufacturer s own piano division or an out side vendor,Irrelevant
A slot is cut in the wood under the piano keyboard but the structural integrity of the piano is not affected,Relevant
The solenoid rail or set of rails is mounted under the piano so that the plungers are under the tails of the keys,Relevant
The recording strip is similarly installed,Relevant
The solenoid links with the pedals are also connected the control box is mounted under the keyboard and the power supply is mounted to the underside of the piano,Relevant
The piano action must be adjusted at this point,Relevant
The keys rest on felt pads that compress with use so the pianos are programmed to play overnight in another burn in process,Relevant
After a 12 hour concert the felt has compressed,Irrelevant
Then the components are checked to see that they have worked properly and the piano action is adjusted to suit the felt compression,Relevant
The pianos are packed and shipped when installation is complete,Relevant
Some manufacturers provide their disc driven systems in kits that can be used to retrofit standard pianos to players,Irrelevant
As the completed subassemblies control boxes and power supplies and recording strips come off the assembly lines they are packaged and stored,Relevant
Kits are then packed with these units as well as disc players and accessories,Relevant
The kits are shipped to installers who have been specially trained to install the particular manufacturer s system,Relevant
Installation typically takes up to two days including an overnight burn in session after which the piano action is adjusted and component workings are checked as they are in the factory,Irrelevant
Polyester is manufactured by one of several methods,Irrelevant
The one used depends on the form the finished polyester will take,Irrelevant
The four basic forms are filament staple tow and fiberfill,Irrelevant
In the filament form each individual strand of polyester fiber is continuous in length producing smooth surfaced fabrics,Irrelevant
In staple form filaments are cut to short predetermined lengths,Irrelevant
In this form polyester is easier to blend with other fibers,Irrelevant
Tow is a form in which continuous filaments are drawn loosely together,Irrelevant
Fiberfill is the voluminous form used in the manufacture of quilts pillows and outerwear,Irrelevant
The two forms used most frequently are filament and staple,Irrelevant
To form polyester dimethyl terephthalate is first reacted with ethylene glycol in the presence of a catalyst at a temperature of 302 410 F 150 210 C ,Relevant
The resulting chemical a monomer single non repeating molecule alcohol is combined with terephthalic acid and raised to a temperature of 472 F 280 C ,Relevant
Newly formed polyester which is clear and molten is extruded through a slot to form long ribbons,Relevant
After the polyester emerges from polymerization the long molten ribbons are allowed to cool until they become brittle,Relevant
The material is cut into tiny chips and completely dried to prevent irregularities in consistency,Relevant
Polymer chips are melted at 500 518 F 260 270 C to form a syrup like solution,Relevant
The solution is put in a metal container called a spinneret and forced through its tiny holes which are usually round but may be pentagonal or any other shape to produce special fibers,Relevant
The number of holes in the spinneret determines the size of the yarn as the emerging fibers are brought together to form a single strand,Irrelevant
At the spinning stage other chemicals may be added to the solution to make the resulting material flame retardant antistatic or easier to dye,Relevant
When polyester emerges from the spinneret it is soft and easily elongated up to five times its original length,Irrelevant
The stretching forces the random polyester molecules to align in a parallel formation,Relevant
This increases the strength tenacity and resilience of the fiber,Irrelevant
This time when the filaments dry the fibers become solid and strong instead of brittle,Irrelevant
Drawn fibers may vary greatly in diameter and length depending on the characteristics desired of the finished material,Irrelevant
Also as the fibers are drawn they may be textured or twisted to create softer or duller fabrics,Relevant
After the polyester yarn is drawn it is wound on large bobbins or flat wound packages ready to be woven into material,Relevant
In making polyester staple fiber polymerization drying and melt spinning steps 1 4 above are much the same as in the manufacture of filament yarn,Irrelevant
However in the melt spinning process the spinneret has many more holes when the product is staple fiber,Irrelevant
The rope like bundles of polyester that emerge are called tow,Irrelevant
Newly formed tow is quickly cooled in cans that gather the thick fibers,Relevant
Several lengths of tow are gathered and then drawn on heated rollers to three or four times their original length,Relevant
Drawn tow is then fed into compression boxes which force the fibers to fold like an accordion at a rate of 9 15 crimps per inch 3 6 per cm ,Relevant
This process helps the fiber hold together during the later manufacturing stages,Irrelevant
After the tow is crimped it is heated at 212 302 F 100 150 C to completely dry the fibers and set the crimp,Relevant
Some of the crimp will unavoidably be pulled out of the fibers during the following processes,Relevant
Following heat setting tow is cut into shorter lengths,Relevant
Polyester that will be blended with cotton is cut in 1 4422 1 50 inch 3 4425 7 8 cm pieces for rayon blends 2 inch 5 cm lengths are cut,Relevant
For heavier fabrics such as carpet polyester filaments are cut into 6 inch 15 cm lengths,Relevant
Printed circuit board processing and assembly are done in an extremely clean environment where the air and components can be kept free of contamination,Irrelevant
Most electronic manufacturers have their own proprietary processes but the following steps might typically be used to make a two sided printed circuit board,Relevant
Woven glass fiber is unwound from a roll and fed through a process station where it is impregnated with epoxy resin either by dipping or spraying,Relevant
The impregnated glass fiber then passes through rollers which roll the material to the desired thick ness for the finished substrate and also remove any excess resin,Relevant
The substrate material passes through an oven where it is semicured,Relevant
After the oven the material is cut into large panels,Relevant
The panels are stacked in layers alternating with layers of adhesive backed copper foil,Relevant
The stacks are placed in a press where they are subjected to temperatures of about 340 F 170 C and pressures of 1500 psi for an hour or more,Relevant
This fully cures the resin and tightly bonds the copper foil to the surface of the substrate material,Irrelevant
Several panels of substrate each large enough to make several printed circuit boards are stacked on top of each other and pinned together to keep them from moving,Relevant
The stacked panels are placed in a CNC machine and the holes are drilled according to the pattern determined when the boards were laid out,Relevant
The holes are deburred to remove any excess material clinging to the edges of the holes,Relevant
The inside surfaces of the holes designed to provide a conductive circuit from one side of the board to the other are plated with copper,Relevant
Non conducting holes are plugged to keep them from being plated or are drilled after the individual boards are cut from the larger panel,Relevant
The printed circuit pattern may be created by an additive process or a subtractive process,Relevant
In the additive process copper is plated or added onto the surface of the substrate in the desired pattern leaving the rest of the surface unplated,Relevant
In the subtractive process the entire surface of the substrate is first plated and then the areas that are not part of the desired pattern are etched away or subtracted,Relevant
We shall describe the additive process,Irrelevant
The foil surface of the substrate is degreased,Relevant
The panels pass through a vacuum chamber where a layer of positive photoresist material is pressed firmly onto the entire surface of the foil,Relevant
A positive photoresist material is a polymer that has the property of becoming more soluble when exposed to ultraviolet light,Irrelevant
The vacuum ensures that no air bubbles are trapped between the foil and the photoresist,Irrelevant
The printed circuit pattern mask is laid on top of the photoresist and the panels are exposed to an intense ultraviolet light,Relevant
Because the mask is clear in the areas of the printed circuit pattern the photoresist in those areas is irradiated and becomes very soluble,Relevant
The mask is removed and the surface of the panels is sprayed with an alkaline developer that dissolves the irradiated photoresist in the areas of the printed circuit pattern leaving the copper foil exposed on the surface of the substrate,Relevant
The panels are then electroplated with copper,Relevant
The foil on the surface of the substrate acts as the cathode in this process and the copper is plated in the exposed foil areas to a thickness of about 0 001 0 002 inches 0 025 0 050 mm ,Relevant
The areas still covered with photoresist cannot act as a cathode and are not plated,Irrelevant
Tin lead or another protective coating is plated on top of the copper plating to prevent the copper from oxidizing and as a resist for the next manufacturing step,Relevant
The photoresist is stripped from the boards with a solvent to expose the substrate s copper foil between the plated printed circuit pattern,Relevant
The boards are sprayed with an acid solution which eats away the copper foil,Relevant
The copper plating on the printed circuit pattern is protected by the tin lead coating and is unaffected by the acid,Irrelevant
The contact fingers are attached to the edge of the substrate to connect with the printed circuit,Relevant
The contact fingers are masked off from the rest of the board and then plated,Relevant
Plating is done with three metals first tin lead next nickel then gold,Irrelevant
The tin lead coating on the surface of the copper printed circuit pattern is very porous and is easily oxidized,Irrelevant
To protect it the panels are passed through a reflow oven or hot oil bath which causes the tin lead to melt or reflow into a shiny surface,Relevant
Each panel is sealed with epoxy to protect the circuits from being damaged while components are being attached,Relevant
Instructions and other markings are stenciled onto the boards,Relevant
The panels are then cut into individual boards and the edges are smoothed,Relevant
Individual boards pass through several machines which place the electronic components in their proper location in the circuit,Irrelevant
If surface mount technology is going to be used to mount the components the boards first pass through an automatic solder paster which places a dab of solder paste at each component contact point,Irrelevant
Very small components may be placed by a chip shooter which rapidly places or shoots the components onto the board,Relevant
Larger components may be robotically placed,Irrelevant
Some components may be too large or odd sized for robotic placement and must be manually placed and soldered later,Irrelevant
The components are then soldered to the circuits,Relevant
With surface mount technology the soldering is done by passing the boards through another reflow process which causes the solder paste to melt and make the connection,Relevant
The flux residue from the solder is cleaned with water or solvents depending on the type of solder used,Relevant
Unless the printed circuit boards are going to be used immediately they are individually packaged in protective plastic bags for storage or shipping,Relevant
The production of signs can involve many different processes depending on whether the retroreflective sheeting uses a heat sensitive or pressure sensitive adhesive and whether silk screening etching or other coloring processes are used,Irrelevant
Many traffic signs however undergo the following process using heat sensitive adhesives,Irrelevant
The sign blank is cut usually from a sheet of steel or aluminum by a metal shear machine or a band saw,Relevant
Corners are rounded using the rounding selection mode on a punch machine,Relevant
Holes for mounting the sign are punched or drilled,Relevant
The blanks are checked for any defects or contamination,Relevant
Blanks must be free of grime in order for background sheeting to adhere properly,Relevant
The Tape Snap test checks for the presence of dirt,Irrelevant
A piece of transparent cellophane tape is applied to the dry blank surface and snapped up at a right angle,Relevant
The presence of color or particles on the tape indicates contamination,Relevant
Any trace of oil or wax is tested by the Water Break exercise,Irrelevant
Water poured over the blank surface should flow evenly and completely beading action denotes contamination,Relevant
The blank surface is wiped with mineral spirits or naphtha to remove greasy fingerprints,Relevant
The surface is dried with a clean lint free cloth before the solution evaporates,Relevant
The blank is then degreased by immersion in a bath of trichloroethylene or percholorethylene vapor,Relevant
Certain alkaline solutions can be used instead of the vapors in the bath,Relevant
A water rinse afterward is not necessary,Relevant
Using scissors razor blades a knife or a paper cutter individual background retroreflective sheets are cut by hand,Irrelevant
Multiple sheets on the other hand are cut using a band saw,Relevant
In this process the shape of the sign is traced on to a 0 125 inch 3 2 mm wallboard,Relevant
This wallboard is laid on top of about 50 sheets secured and nailed to a hardboard cutting base,Relevant
The band saw follows the pattern and cuts the sheets,Relevant
Letters and symbols are punched out from white or black retroreflective sheeting either by hand or by using a clicker press,Relevant
Up to 29 sheets can be placed in the press at once cutting dies which function much like cookie dough cutters are placed in the machine to produce the desired characters,Relevant
The adhesive liner on the back of the background sheeting is removed in one motion and the sheeting is applied to the dry blank surface,Relevant
The sign is cranked through a large squeeze roller applicator to remove air bubbles trapped between the sheeting and the blank,Relevant
Edges are then trimmed,Relevant
The sign is placed in a heat lamp vacuum applicator for one minute removed and allowed to cool before the sign copy and border are placed on the sign,Relevant
The squeezeroller applicator or a hand roller is used over the copy to eliminate air bubbles,Relevant
The sign is then covered with a plastic slipsheet and placed in the heat lamp vacuum applicator for another minute,Relevant
Fibers and filaments are first formed into yarn,Relevant
The yarn is then twisted braided or plaited according to the type of rope being made,Relevant
The diameter of the rope is determined by the diameter of the yarn the number of yarns per strand and the number of strands or braids in the finished rope,Irrelevant
If the rope is to be made from raw natural fibers the fibers are first lubricated with a natural oil,Relevant
They are then fed into a series of machines that remove any dirt straighten the fibers spread them apart and comb them with several sets of steel toothed combs,Relevant
Each set of combs has the teeth set closer together as the fibers proceed through the process,Relevant
This produces a loose continuous ribbon of fibers called a sliver,Relevant
The fibers in the sliver have been aligned along the long axis of the ribbon,Relevant
Synthetic fibers follow a similar process but tend to align more easily,Irrelevant
If the rope is to be made from long filaments of synthetic material several filaments are grouped together in a process called doubling or throwing,Relevant
This produces a sliver of multiple plies of filaments,Irrelevant
The sliver is run through the rollers of a drawing machine to compress it before it is twisted into yarn,Relevant
Yarn that has a right hand twist to the right and up when viewed from the end is said to have a Z twist and yarn that has a left handed twist to the left and up is said to have an S twist,Irrelevant
Sometimes this is referred to as right hand laid yarn and left hand laid yarn,Irrelevant
The finished yarn is wound on spools called bobbins,Irrelevant
At this point the yarn may be dyed various colors to produce a strand or an entire rope of a particular color,Irrelevant
This is especially helpful in finding a specific line in a maze of rigging on a sailboat,Irrelevant
The bobbins of yarn are set on a frame known as a creel,Relevant
For three strand right hand twist rope Z twist yarns would be used to make each strand,Irrelevant
The ends of the yarns are fed through a hole in a register plate which keeps the yarns in the proper relation to each other,Relevant
The ends of the yarns are then fed into a compression tube,Relevant
As the yarn is pulled through the compression tube the tube twists it in the S twist direction opposite of the yarn twist to produce a tight strand,Relevant
The strands are either transferred to strand bobbins or fed directly into the closing machine,Relevant
For common three strand rope three S twist strands would be used,Irrelevant
The closing machine holds the strands firmly with a tube like clamp called a laying top,Irrelevant
The end of each strand is then passed through a rotating die which twists the strands in the Z twist direction locking them together,Relevant
This process is called closing the rope,Irrelevant
The finished rope is wound onto a reel,Relevant
When the end of the strands has been reached the finished coil of rope is removed from the reel and tied together with bands of smaller rope,Relevant
The ends are either taped or if the rope is a synthetic material melted with heat to prevent them from unraveling,Relevant
Braided ropes are commonly made from synthetic materials,Relevant
The bobbins of yarn are set up on several moving pendants on a braiding machine,Relevant
Each pendant travels in an oscillating pattern weaving the yarn into a tight braid,Relevant
A set of rollers pulls the braid through a guide to lock or set the braid and keep tension on the rope,Relevant
In some machines the braiding process is accomplished by feeding the yarns through separate counter rotating register plates,Irrelevant
One yarn is woven in one direction followed by another in the opposite direction and so on to form an interlocked braid,Relevant
If a double braided rope is being formed the first braid becomes the core and the second braid is immediately woven on top of it to form the outer covering called the coat,Relevant
As the rope emerges from the rollers it is taken up on a reel,Relevant
The finished coil is then removed and banded and the ends are taped or melted,Relevant
Eight plaited rope consists of four S twist strands and four Z twist strands,Irrelevant
The strands are paired together with one S twist and one Z twist in each pair,Relevant
These pairs are then held together and braided with the other pairs,Relevant
The manufacturing process first follows the twisted rope process to make the strands then the braided rope process to form the final rope,Relevant
The telescoping boom rough terrain forklift is generally manufactured in separate functional group sections hydraulics powertrain engine transmission etc electrical chassis and boom,Irrelevant
Individual components are either purchased or created from raw materials and joined into subassemblies,Irrelevant
The subassemblies are then brought together in the final assembly area where the forklift is completed,Irrelevant
The actual flow of work varies from one manufacturer to another but the following is a typical process,Irrelevant
The raw steel materialsheet plate bars and tubesare first cut to size and machined,Relevant
Plate up to 0 75 inch 1 9 cm thick is cut into shape or burned by oxyacetylene or plasma gas cutting torches controlled by numerical controlled machines,Relevant
Thinner steel sheet is cut with a shear and bent into shape as required by press brakes,Relevant
During the cutting and machining the steel is held in place with large fixtures or clamping devices to ensure dimensional accuracy,Irrelevant
The parts which will be welded together are first tack welded in place,Relevant
These would include components of the chassis cab and boom among others,Irrelevant
A tack weld is simply a small weld or fusion of the two pieces of material to keep the pieces from shifting during the final welding process,Irrelevant
The whole assembly is then welded by numerical controlled NC machines which place the welds in exactly the right areas with the right welding temperatures and the right feed rate for the welding rod,Relevant
This is important to obtain a weld which will provide the required strength and meet the standards of the American Welding Society,Irrelevant
As with the machining step a variety of fixtures are used to ensure dimensional accuracy,Irrelevant
At this station steel parts are placed on a rotating table or a conveyor belt in a large chamber,Relevant
When the chamber doors close the parts are blasted with thousands of BB sized metal pellets that are shot at high speed from dozens of openings in the walls of the chamber,Relevant
This process cleans away the rough scale that naturally forms on the surface of steel when it comes from the steel mill,Relevant
It also cleans away the small welding splatter commonly found in the welded areas,Relevant
This shot blasting is the first step in preparing the parts for painting,Relevant
The frame cab boom and body of a telescoping boom rough terrain forklift are usually fabricated by the forklift manufacturer,Relevant
The remainder of the parts are usually purchased as finished products and are installed by the forklift manufacturer,Relevant
Purchased products include the engine transmission axles wheels tires brakes seat gauges lights back up alarm hoses and hydraulic cylinders,Irrelevant
All exposed parts except the boom are now painted to protect the surfaces,Relevant
The boom is painted after the telescoping sections have been manually assembled in step 5,Relevant
In preparation all parts are thoroughly washed in a detergent bath and then rinsed,Relevant
A second acid wash and rinse cleans the metal further and also applies a thin phosphorus coating to improve paint adherence,Relevant
In the paint booth fine paint particles are sprayed from a spraygun that also imparts an electrostatic charge to each particle,Relevant
The part being painted is electrically charged to the opposite polarity of the paint,Irrelevant
This causes the paint to be drawn to the part and results in an even coat of paint over the entire surface,Irrelevant
After painting the parts are baked in ovens to produce a hard coating,Relevant
The parts are now sent to several functional group work stations,Relevant
The boom is built at one station the cab at another the chassis at another and so on,Irrelevant
The boom is made of two to four rectangular sections of long hollow steel tube,Irrelevant
The size of each section is smaller than the previous one and the sections slide or telescope into each other,Irrelevant
Inside each section a hydraulic cylinder and chain device cause the boom sections to extend or retract when maneuvering loads,Relevant
Nylon guides prevent the steel sections from rubbing on each other and stops are installed to prevent the sections from sliding out of each other when the boom is operating below grade level at a downward angle,Relevant
The chassis work group installs electrical wiring and hoses and bolts the engine supports in place,Relevant
The cab group installs the instrument panel controls wiring and seat,Relevant
The powertrain group joins the transmission to the engine mounts the engine accessories and hydraulic pumps and connects electrical wiring to various sensors on the engine,Relevant
All of the subassemblies are now brought to the final assembly area,Relevant
The tires wheels hubs and brakes are installed on the axles and the axles are installed on the underside of the chassis,Relevant
The engine and transmission are lowered into the chassis and secured to their mounts,Relevant
The drive shaft s connecting the transmission and the drive axle s are connected,Relevant
The cab fuel tank and hydraulic fluid tank are installed,Relevant
The boom assembly is lowered onto its pivot point and the hydraulic cylinders that raise and lower the boom are installed,Relevant
Hose and electrical connections are made between all the subassemblies,Relevant
Fluids oil hydraulic fluid fuel are added as required,Relevant
Instruction and warning decals are applied in the cab and on the boom,Relevant
Each unit is started and run through a series of functional tests with actual loads for up to 1 5 hours,Relevant
Any final adjustments or settings are made at this time,Relevant
Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail,Relevant
Two or three forklifts are usually shipped on the same load to minimize the freight charges,Irrelevant
The modern manufacture of safety pins is completely automatic,Irrelevant
Specialized machines have been developed to perform multiple steps replacing many workers and increasing the efficiency of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
Over 3 million safety pins can be made by one factory in a day almost 1 billion a year,Irrelevant
There are only two U S companies that make safety pins although there are many more companies abroad,Irrelevant
Steel wire is refined from pig iron an early stage in iron refining,Irrelevant
The ore at this point still contains many impurities including carbon which makes iron very brittle,Irrelevant
In a converter a high temperature oven oxygen is pumped at high speed into the molten pig iron to burn out the carbon,Relevant
The molten steel is then formed into slabs by a method known as continuous casting,Relevant
The metal is poured into a mold,Relevant
Water jets cool the metal while straightening rollers form the mass into a bar called a billet,Relevant
It is then pickled in acid to remove oxide scale passed through rollers heat treated and then cooled slowly a process known as annealing,Relevant
The cold metal is then shaped into wire by drawing it through several dies of decreasing size,Relevant
During this stage the metal undergoes frequent annealing to prevent brittleness,Relevant
As it passes through increasingly narrower dies the wire achieves the correct gauge thickness ,Relevant
At the pin factory coils of high carbon spring steel wire are loaded onto spools and fed into the roll straightener,Relevant
This machine straightens and cuts the wire to the correct length from an inch up to a foot long,Relevant
Most cutting machines can be adjusted to accommodate various diameters of wire,Irrelevant
The cut wire pieces are carried by conveyors or by cart to the grinding machines,Relevant
The wire pieces are hopper fed and pressed against grinding wheels,Relevant
One end of the wire is ground to a point,Irrelevant
It is also in the grinder that the metal pieces are polished and nicks and burrs removed from the tapered edges,Relevant
The forming process is done by a fourslide machine which allows for a range of motions in four directions,Relevant
The machine is custom tooled to form the safety pin,Irrelevant
The wire pins are hopper fed into the machine where they are picked up on a chain,Relevant
They are then coiled around an arbor or spindle,Relevant
The unsharpened end is bent into a hook that will hold the cap,Relevant
Meanwhile steel sheets are fed into the machine from the other side,Relevant
The sheets of metal are stamped on a die producing oddly shaped pieces that will form the doughnut shaped cap,Relevant
A stamping operation forms the two dimensional die cut steel pieces into three dimensional caps,Relevant
Inside the machine the sharpened hooked and coiled wire meets up with the cap,Relevant
The cap is then crimped around the hooked end of the wire,Relevant
At this point the safety pin is fully formed and the clasp is closed,Relevant
For those users who purchase the safety pins with the point open and ready to use the cost is higher,Irrelevant
A mechanical device at the end of the chains opens the pins and finishing must be done in smaller batches as the pins nest and tangle together,Relevant
The pins are loaded into perforated plastic baskets,Relevant
If plating is required steel pins are generally chromed while brass pins are nickel plated,Relevant
In electroplating the formed pins are placed into a tank of the coating solution,Relevant
The tank is electrically charged forcing the chemicals in the solution to adhere to the pins in a fme layer,Relevant
The electroplated pins are shaken by the rotating tank to ensure an even coating,Relevant
The pins are rinsed off with water and then placed in another tank where a chemical bath gives them their final polish,Relevant
The pins are washed in a detergent solution and given a wax finish,Relevant
The formed and finished pins are then packaged,Relevant
Lots of 10 gross per box is the standard bulk or industrial pack,Irrelevant
Most consumers purchase safety pins in retail polybags or blister packs,Irrelevant
Underground salt deposits are usually discovered by prospectors searching for water or oil,Irrelevant
When salt is detected a diamond tipped hollow drill is used to take several regularly spaced core samples throughout the area,Relevant
These samples are analyzed to determine if salt mining would be profitable,Relevant
When a site is selected for mining shafts are sunk into the center of the salt deposit,Relevant
Then a machine that looks like a gigantic chain saw is used to cut a slot about 6 0 inches 15 cm high about 66 feet 20 m wide and about 10 feet 3 m deep into the salt at floor level,Relevant
This process is known as undercutting,Irrelevant
A series of holes are drilled into the undercut salt with an electric drill containing a tungsten carbide bit,Relevant
These holes are filled with an explosive such as dynamite or ammonium nitrate,Relevant
Electric blasting caps connected to long wires are attached and the explosive is detonated from a safe distance,Relevant
Cutting and blasting are repeated in a pattern that leaves pillars of salt standing to support the roof of the mining area,Relevant
This is known as the room and pillar method and is also used in coal mines,Irrelevant
Chunks of blasted rock salt are transported to an underground crushing area,Relevant
Here they are passed over a grating known as a grizzly which collects pieces smaller than about 9 inches 23 cm ,Relevant
Larger pieces are crushed in a rotating cylinder between metal jaws with spiked teeth,Relevant
The salt is then transported outside the mine to a secondary crushing area where a smaller grizzly and a smaller crusher reduce the particle size to about 3 2 inches 8 cm ,Relevant
At this point foreign matter is removed from the salt a process known as picking,Irrelevant
Metal is removed by magnets and other material by hand,Relevant
Rocky material may also be removed in a Bradford breaker a rotating metal drum with small holes in the bottom,Relevant
Salt is dumped into the drum breaks when it hits the bottom and passes through the holes,Relevant
Rocky matter is generally harder than salt so it does not break and does not go through,Irrelevant
The picked salt then goes to a tertiary crushing area where an even smaller grizzly and crusher produce particles about 1 0 inch 2 5 cm in size,Relevant
If smaller particles are needed the salt is passed through a grinder consisting of two metal cylinders rolling against each other,Relevant
If purer salt is needed rock salt is dissolved in water to form brine for further processing,Relevant
Otherwise the crushed or ground salt is passed through screens to sort it by size poured into bags and shipped to the consumer,Relevant
The simplest method of evaporating brine is solar evaporation but it can only be used in hot dry sunny places,Irrelevant
The brine is collected into shallow ponds and allowed to evaporate in the sun,Relevant
Insoluble impurities such as sand and clay and slightly soluble impurities such as calcium carbonate settle to the bottom as evaporation begins,Relevant
The brine is pumped or moved by gravity flow to another pond where calcium sulfate settles out as evaporation continues,Relevant
The remaining brine is moved to yet another pond where the salt settles out as evaporation proceeds,Relevant
The brine is moved one more time before evaporation is complete to prevent highly soluble impurities such as magnesium chloride magnesium sulfate potassium chloride and magnesium bromide from settling out with the salt,Relevant
These substances may be collected separately for commercial use,Relevant
Rock salt is simply crystallized salt,Relevant
It is the result of the evaporation of ancient oceans millions of years ago,Irrelevant
Large deposits of rock salt are found in the United States Canada Germany eastern Europe and China,Irrelevant
The salt is scooped up by machines running on temporary railroad tracks laid on top of the layer of salt,Relevant
It is then washed with highly concentrated salt water,Relevant
This water contains so much salt that it cannot hold any more so the salt is washed free of any trace impurities without dissolving,Relevant
The washed salt is removed from the salt water rinsed with a small amount of fresh water and piled into huge stacks to drain for two or three months,Relevant
At this point the salt is about 99 4% pure and can be used for many industrial purposes,Relevant
If purer salt is needed it is rewashed in salt water and fresh water allowed to drain for one or two days then dried in a hot air oven at about 365 F 185 C ,Relevant
This salt is about 99 8% pure and can be used for food processing,Relevant
Most brine is processed by a multiple effect vacuum evaporator,Irrelevant
This device consists of three or more closed metal cylinders with conical bottoms,Relevant
Brine is first treated chemically to remove calcium and magnesium compounds,Relevant
It then fills the bottom of the cylinders,Relevant
The brine in the first cylinder passes through tubes heated by steam,Relevant
The brine boils and its steam enters the next cylinder where it heats the brine there,Relevant
The steam from this brine heats the brine in the next cylinder and so on,Relevant
In each cylinder the condensation of steam causes the pressure inside to drop allowing the brine to boil at a lower temperature,Relevant
Salt is removed from the bottom of the cylinders as a thick slurry,Relevant
It is filtered to remove excess brine dried and passed through screens to sort the particles by size,Relevant
Salt made this way is known as vacuum pan salt and consists of small cubic crystals,Irrelevant
Brine is water containing a high concentration of salt,Irrelevant
The most obvious source of brine is the ocean but it can also be obtained from salty lakes and underground pools of salt water,Irrelevant
Brine may also be processed in a grainer,Irrelevant
The brine is chemically purified and pumped into a long open pan heated by steam running through pipes immersed in the brine,Relevant
The brine is heated to a temperature slightly below the boiling point and flakes of salt form on its surface as it evaporates,Relevant
Usually a temperature of about 194 F 90 C is used,Relevant
Lower temperatures produce larger flakes and higher temperatures produce smaller flakes,Irrelevant
The flakes grow until they sink to the bottom of the pan where they are collected and dried,Relevant
Grainer salt consists of small flakes rather than cubes and is preferred for certain uses in food processing,Relevant
Sometimes the Alberger process is used in which the brine is first partially evaporated in a vacuum evaporator then moved to a grainer,Irrelevant
This process produces a mixture of flakes and cubes,Irrelevant
At this point salt used for most purposes is ready to be packaged in bags or boxes and shipped to consumers,Relevant
To make iodized table salt however potassium iodide is added then magnesium carbonate calcium silicate calcium phosphate magnesium silicate or calcium carbonate is added to make it free flowing,Relevant
The salt is then packaged and shipped to restaurants and grocery stores,Relevant
The polymer based adhesive is mixed and placed into the machine which applies the glue to the paper,Relevant
For preprinted pads the memo headings are printed onto large sheets of paper,Relevant
The paper is placed into the machine and prepared to be fed through the priming device,Relevant
As the paper passes through the machine continuous rollers prime the back side of the paper with a substrate,Relevant
Next the polymer glue is applied on top of the substrate,Relevant
As the paper passes from the glue application another device stacks the sheets of paper on top of each other to form large pads,Relevant
Attached to the bottom of the pad is a piece of paper listing the company and brand names,Relevant
The pads are cut into smaller square and rectangular pads in the standard sizes ranging from the smaller 1 5 by 2 0 inches 3 8 by 5 1 cm to 8 5 by 11 22 by 28 cm ,Relevant
The pads are labeled with the product name and manufacturer and wrapped in plastic,Relevant
The pads are packaged together in bulk into larger boxes and shipped to distributors and wholesalers,Relevant
Only the healthiest moths are used for breeding,Irrelevant
Their eggs are categorized graded and meticulously tested for infection,Relevant
Unhealthy eggs are burned,Relevant
The healthiest eggs may be placed in cold storage until they are ready to be hatched,Relevant
Once the eggs are incubated they usually hatch within seven days,Relevant
They emerge at a mere one eighth of an inch 3 2 mm long and must be maintained in a carefully controlled environment,Relevant
Under normal conditions the eggs would hatch once a year in the spring when mulberry trees begin to leaf,Irrelevant
But with the intervention of sericulturists breeding can occur as many as three times per year,Irrelevant
The silkworms feed only on the leaves of the mulberry tree,Irrelevant
The mulberry leaves are finely chopped and fed to the voracious silkworms every few hours for 20 to 35 days,Relevant
During this period the wormns increase in size to about 3 5 inches 8 9 cm ,Relevant
They also shed their skin or molt four times and change color from gray to a translucent pinkish color,Relevant
When the silkworm starts to fidget and toss its head back and forth it is preparing to spin its cocoon,Relevant
The caterpillar attaches itself to either a twig or rack for support,Relevant
As the worm twists its head it spins a double strand of fiber in a figure eight pattern and constructs a symmetrical wall around itself,Relevant
The filament is secreted from each of two glands called the spinneret located under the jaws of the silkworm,Relevant
The insoluble protein like fiber is called fibroin,Irrelevant
The fibroin is held together by sericin a soluble gum secreted by the worm which hardens as soon as it is exposed to air,Relevant
The result is the raw silk fiber called the bave,Relevant
The caterpillar spins a cocoon encasing itself completely,Relevant
It can then safely transform into the chrysalis which is the pupa stage,Irrelevant
The natural course would be for the chrysalis to break through the protective cocoon and emerge as a moth,Relevant
However sericulturists must destroy the chrysalis so that it does not break the silk filament,Relevant
This is done by stoving or stifling the chrysalis with heat,Relevant
The filature is the factory in which the cocoons are processed into silk thread,Irrelevant
In the filature the cocoons are sorted by various characteristics including color and size so that the finished product can be of uniform quality,Irrelevant
The cocoons must then be soaked in hot water to loosen the sericin,Relevant
Although the silk is about 20% sericin only 1% is removed at this stage,Irrelevant
This way the gum facilitates the following stage in which the filaments are combined to form silk thread or yarn,Irrelevant
Reeling may be achieved manually or automatically,Irrelevant
The cocoon is brushed to locate the end of the fiber,Relevant
It is threaded through a porcelain eyelet and the fiber is reeled onto a wheel,Relevant
Meanwhile diligent operators check for flaws in the filaments as they are being reeled,Relevant
As each filament is nearly finished being reeled a new fiber is twisted onto it thereby forming one long continuous thread,Relevant
Sericin contributes to the adhesion of the fibers to each other,Irrelevant
The end product the raw silk filaments are reeled into skeins,Relevant
These skeins are packaged into bundles weighing 5 10 pounds 2 4 kg called books,Relevant
The books are further packaged into bales of 133 pounds 60 kg and transported to manufacturing centers,Relevant
Silk thread also called yarn is formed by throwing or twisting the reeled silk,Relevant
First the skeins of raw silk are categorized by color size and quantity,Relevant
Next they are soaked in warm water mixed with oil or soap to soften the sericin,Relevant
The silk is then dried,Relevant
As the silk filaments are reeled onto bobbins they are twisted in a particular manner to achieve a certain texture of yarn,Relevant
For instance singles consist of several filaments which are twisted together in one direction,Irrelevant
They are turned tightly for sheer fabrics and loosely for thicker fabrics,Irrelevant
Combinations of singles and untwisted fibers may be twisted together in certain patterns to achieve desired textures of fabrics such as crepe de chine voile or tram,Irrelevant
Fibers may also be manufactured in different patterns for use in the nap of fabrics for the outside or for the inside of the fabric,Irrelevant
The silk yarn is put through rollers to make the width more uniform,Relevant
The yarn is inspected weighed and packaged,Relevant
Finally the yarn is shipped to fabric manufacturers,Relevant
To achieve the distinctive softness and shine of silk the remaining sericin must be removed from the yarn by soaking it in warm soapy water,Relevant
Degumming decreases the weight of the yarn by as much as 25%,Irrelevant
After degumming the silk yarn is a creamy white color,Relevant
It may next be dyed as yarn or after the yarn has been woven into fabric,Relevant
The silk industry makes a distinction between pure dye silk and what is called weighted silk,Irrelevant
In the pure dye process the silk is colored with dye and may be finished with water soluble substances such as starch glue sugar or gelatin,Irrelevant
To produce weighted silk metallic substances are added to the fabric during the dying process,Relevant
This is done to increase the weight lost during degumming and to add body to the fabric,Irrelevant
If weighting is not executed properly it can decrease the longevity of the fabric so pure dye silk is considered the superior product,Irrelevant
After dyeing silk fabric may be finished by additional processes such as bleaching embossing steaming or stiffening,Relevant
Not all of the silk filament is usable for reeled silk,Irrelevant
The leftover silk may include the brushed ends or broken cocoons,Irrelevant
This shorter staple silk may be used for spinning silk in a manner of fabrics like cotton and linen,Irrelevant
The quality of spun silk is slightly inferior to reeled silk in that it is a bit weaker and it tends to become fuzzy,Irrelevant
The waste material from the spun silk can also be used for making waste silk or silk noil,Irrelevant
This coarse material is commonly used for draperies and upholstery ,Irrelevant
Modern skis can be classified into three different types laminated torsion box and single shell,Irrelevant
The laminated method is the one most commonly used in ski manufacturing since the combination of various materials allows for greater array of models,Irrelevant
Laminated skis may contain one or all of the following materials plastic fiberglass carbon wood steel aluminum neoprene or ceramics,Irrelevant
These elements are sandwiched or layered on the top and bottom of the core,Relevant
In a torsion box ski the core material is surrounded by fiberglass or carbon fibers,Relevant
Instead of being sandwiched around the core the layers wrap around it in what is known as wet wrap construction,Relevant
The core is then sealed with resin and heat ,Relevant
This more complex manufacturing process means that torsion box skis are more expensive than laminated ones but they provide better handling and thus are more appealing to serious skiers ,Irrelevant
Single shell skis are made from a strong inner material such as wood but enclosed by a flexible fiberglass or plastic shell and sides ,Irrelevant
The lighter weight of single shell skis means that more control is located at the tip of the skis giving the user better steering control and turning ability ,Irrelevant
The manufacturing process for most skis originates in a warehouse type room of the factory ,Irrelevant
Here all the raw materialsthe roughly cut blocks of wood for wood cores the steel edges sheets of polyethylene for the bases rolls of fiberglass or aluminumare sorted and stacked ,Irrelevant
For skis with wood cores the pre laminated wood is put through a mill for precise cutting and finishing ,Relevant
These mills are computer operated by a technician who sets the parameters through numerical controls on the machine ,Relevant
This process is also used for aluminum cores ,Irrelevant
The machine cuts and mills the material including the core s thickness and side cut and also collects the excess which are returned to the suppliers ,Relevant
In skis with polyurethane cores the top and base layers are put into a mold then a press and the foam is injected with a hose ,Relevant
As it expands and hardens the foam fuses the layers and becomes the core ,Relevant
Modern skis can be classified into three different types ,Irrelevant
In laminated skis various layers sandwich the core on top and bottom ,Irrelevant
In torsion box ski construction the layers wrap around the core ,Irrelevant
In single shell construction polyurethane foam is sometimes injected into the ski shell ,Irrelevant
As this foam expands and hardens the top and sides form one sheet ,Irrelevant
In the next step the core and the rest of the layers including the top and base are placed into a mold and then into a press ,Relevant
Heat and pressure result in a rudimentary ski then epoxy resin is used to completely seal the layers together ,Relevant
Single shell or cap skis require a more complicated assembly process and more precise molding chambers,Irrelevant
They still use wood or foam cores but the top and sides are united in one sheet and this makes the core less integral to the ski s overall performance,Irrelevant
The polyethylene base the running surface of the ski is bonded onto the ski,Relevant
Steel edges are also bonded onto the ski surface,Relevant
Another important difference between the laminated and torsion box types of skis and single shell ones is the application of graphics,Irrelevant
Flashy colors and logos are a trademark of ski design and manufacturers use graphics to differentiate their models,Irrelevant
In single shell skis graphics are applied to the top or cap before the parts go into the mold,Irrelevant
The heat transfer process is commonly used a method that can best be compared to the way an emblem is applied to a t shirt with an iron,Irrelevant
In the ski industry this process is called sublimation and it yields a visually complex but clear image,Irrelevant
Another method used in single shell graphics applications is backprinting in which graphics are applied in reverse to a clear sheet through silk screening then flipped over,Irrelevant
During assembly the freshly applied graphics remain protected during the molding stage,Irrelevant
With traditional laminated and torsion box skis the graphics are applied in one of the final steps of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
The actual ski goes through a silkscreen process where the design is first put on a piece of silk or other thin fabric,Irrelevant
The areas which are not to be colored are covered with an impermeable substance and then ink is forced through the fabric,Relevant
This must be done several times over one press for each color and the ski must be allowed to dry between presses,Relevant
A curtain coat of lacquer is then applied,Relevant
Because of the complexities of this process skis made this way often take days to dry whereas single shell skis can be finished in a matter of hours,Irrelevant
The final finishing process is nearly the same among all types of skis,Irrelevant
The bases must be put through a machine that grinds and polishes them and this is done with a combination of belt sanding and stone grinding,Relevant
Stone grinding is considered superior to the belt method,Irrelevant
Next the skis must be matched up into pairs,Relevant
The edges are also beveled and polished,Relevant
This is done with a machine that tests their flexibility and camber,Relevant
After they are paired a quality control technician makes certain that they are well matched,Relevant
In the final stages the steel edges are oiled the skis waxed wrapped in polyethylene and boxed for shipping to retail outlets,Relevant
The production of a smoke detector consists of two major steps,Irrelevant
One is fabrication of the Am 241 into a form typically a foil that can be installed into the sensing and reference chambers,Irrelevant
The other is assembly of the entire ICSD beginning either with all of the individual components or with prefabricated sensing and reference chambers obtained from the manufacturer of the radioactive source material,Irrelevant
The following description covers all steps even though some may be done by different manufacturers,Irrelevant
Tests and inspections at several stages of the assembly process ensure a reliable product,Irrelevant
The process begins with the compound AmO 2 an oxide of Am 241,Irrelevant
This substance is thoroughly mixed with gold shaped into a briquette and fused by pressure and heat at over 1470 F 800 C ,Relevant
A backing of silver and a front covering of gold or gold alloy are applied to the briquette and sealed by hot forging,Relevant
The briquette is then processed through several stages of cold rolling to achieve the desired thickness and levels of radiation emission,Relevant
The final thickness is about 0 008 inches 0 2 mm with the gold cover representing about one percent of the thickness,Relevant
The resulting foil strip which is about 0 8 inches 20 mm wide is cut into sections 39 inches 1 meter long,Relevant
Circular ICSD source elements are punched out of the foil strip,Relevant
Each disc which is about 0 2 inches 5 mm in diameter is mounted in a metal holder,Relevant
A thin metal rim on the holder is rolled over to completely seal the cut edge around the disc,Relevant
One disc of source material is mounted in the sensing chamber and another is mounted in the adjacent reference chamber,Relevant
The electrodes are installed in both chambers and connected to external leads which project out of the bottoms of the chambers,Relevant
Printed circuit boards are prepared from design schematics by punching holes for the component leads and by laying a copper trace on the back to form the paths for electric currents,Relevant
On the assembly line the various electronic components diodes capacitors resistors etc are inserted into the proper holes on the board,Relevant
Leads extending out the back of the board are trimmed,Relevant
The sensing chamber reference chamber and an alarm horn are installed on the printed circuit board,Relevant
The board then passes over a wave solder machine which solders the electronic components into place,Relevant
The plastic housing consists of a mounting base and a cover,Irrelevant
Both are made by injection molding process in which powdered plastic and molding pigments are mixed heated forced into a mold under pressure then cooled to form the final pieces,Relevant
The circuit board is seated on the plastic mounting base,Relevant
A test button is installed so the device can be tested periodically after installation in the home,Relevant
A mounting bracket is added to the base and the cover is added to complete the assembly,Relevant
The smoke detector is packaged in a cardboard box along with a battery and an owner s manual,Relevant
The kettle method of making soap is still used today by small soap manufacturing companies,Irrelevant
This process takes from four to eleven days to complete and the quality of each batch is inconsistent due to the variety of oils used,Irrelevant
Around 1940 engineers and scientists developed a more efficient manufacturing process called the continuous process,Irrelevant
This procedure is employed by large soap manufacturing companies all around the world today,Irrelevant
Exactly as the name states in the continuous process soap is produced continuously rather than one batch at a time,Irrelevant
Technicians have more control of the production in the continuous process and the steps are much quicker than in the kettle methodit takes only about six hours to complete a batch of soap,Irrelevant
Fats and alkali are melted in a kettle which is a steel tank that can stand three stories high and hold several thousand pounds of material,Relevant
Steam coils within the kettle heat the batch and bring it to a boil,Relevant
After boiling the mass thickens as the fat reacts with the alkali producing soap and glycerin,Relevant
The soap and glycerin must now be separated,Relevant
The mixture is treated with salt causing the soap to rise to the top and the glycerin to settle to the bottom,Relevant
The glycerin is extracted from the bottom of the kettle,Relevant
To remove the small amounts of fat that have not saponified a strong caustic solution is added to the kettle,Relevant
This step in the process is called strong change,Irrelevant
The mass is brought to a boil again and the last of the fat turns to soap The batch may be given another salt treatment at this time or the manufacturer may proceed to the next step 4 The next step is called pitching,Relevant
The soap in the kettle is boiled again with added water The mass eventually separates into two layers The top layer is called neat soap which is about 70% soap and 30% water,Relevant
The lower layer called nigre contains most of the impurities in the soap such as dirt and salt as well as most of the water,Irrelevant
The neat soap is taken off the top,Relevant
The soap is then cooled,Relevant
The finishing process is the same as for soap made by the continuous process,Irrelevant
Developed around 1940 and used by today s major soap making companies the above illustrations show the continuous process of making soap,Irrelevant
The first step of the continuous process splits natural fat into fatty acids and glycerin,Relevant
The equipment used is a vertical stainless steel column with the diameter of a barrel called a hydrolizer,Irrelevant
It may be as tall as 80 feet 24 m ,Irrelevant
Pumps and meters attached to the column allow precise measurements and control of the process,Irrelevant
Molten fat is pumped into one end of the column while at the other end water at high temperature 266 F [130 C] and pressure is introduced,Relevant
This splits the fat into its two components,Relevant
The fatty acid and glycerin are pumped out continuously as more fat and water enter,Relevant
The fatty acids are then distilled for purification,Relevant
The purified fatty acids are next mixed with a precise amount of alkali to form soap,Relevant
Other ingredients such as abrasives and fragrance are also mixed in,Relevant
The hot liquid soap may be then whipped to incorporate air,Relevant
The soap may be poured into molds and allowed to harden into a large slab,Relevant
It may also be cooled in a special freezer,Relevant
The slab is cut into smaller pieces of bar size which are then stamped and wrapped,Relevant
The entire continuous process from splitting to finishing can be accomplished in several hours,Irrelevant
Most toiletry soap undergoes additional processing called milling,Irrelevant
The milled bar lathers up better and has a finer consistency than non milled soap,Irrelevant
The cooled soap is fed through several sets of heavy rollers mills which crush and knead it,Irrelevant
Perfumes can best be incorporated at this time because their volatile oils do not evaporate in the cold mixture,Relevant
After the soap emerges from the mills it is pressed into a smooth cylinder and extruded,Relevant
The extruded soap is cut into bar size stamped and wrapped,Relevant
Most soft drinks are made at local bottling and canning companies,Irrelevant
Brand name franchise companies grant licenses to bottlers to mix the soft drinks in strict accordance to their secret formulas and their required manufacturing procedures,Irrelevant
The quality of water is crucial to the success of a soft drink,Irrelevant
Impurities such as suspended particles organic matter and bacteria may degrade taste and color,Irrelevant
They are generally removed through the traditional process of a series of coagulation filtration and chlorination,Irrelevant
Coagulation involves mixing a gelatinous precipitate or floc ferric sulphate or aluminum sulphate into the water,Relevant
The floc absorbs suspended particles making them larger and more easily trapped by filters,Relevant
During the clarification process alkalinity must be adjusted with an addition of lime to reach the desired pH level,Relevant
The clarified water is poured through a sand filter to remove fine particles of floc,Relevant
The water passes through a layer of sand and courser beds of gravel to capture the particles,Relevant
Sterilization is necessary to destroy bacteria and organic compounds that might spoil the water s taste or color,Relevant
The water is pumped into a storage tank and is dosed with a small amount of free chlorine,Relevant
The chlorinated water remains in the storage tank for about two hours until the reaction is complete,Irrelevant
Next an activated carbon filter dechlorinates the water and removes residual organic matter much like the sand filter,Relevant
A vacuum pump de aerates the water before it passes into a dosing station,Relevant
The dissolved sugar and flavor concentrates are pumped into the dosing station in a predetermined sequence according to their compatibility,Relevant
The ingredients are conveyed into batch tanks where they are carefully mixed too much agitation can cause unwanted aeration,Relevant
The syrup may be sterilized while in the tanks using ultraviolet radiation or flash pasteurization which involves quickly heating and cooling the mixture,Relevant
Fruit based syrups generally must be pasteurized,Irrelevant
The water and syrup are carefully combined by sophisticated machines called proportioners which regulate the flow rates and ratios of the liquids,Relevant
The vessels are pressurized with carbon dioxide to prevent aeration of the mixture,Relevant
Carbonation is generally added to the finished product though it may be mixed into the water at an earlier stage,Relevant
The temperature of the liquid must be carefully controlled since carbon dioxide solubility increases as the liquid temperature decreases,Relevant
Many carbonators are equipped with their own cooling systems,Irrelevant
The amount of carbon dioxide pressure used depends on the type of soft drink,Irrelevant
For instance fruit drinks require far less carbonation than mixer drinks such as tonics which are meant to be diluted with other liquids,Irrelevant
The beverage is slightly over pressured with carbon dioxide to facilitate the movement into storage tanks and ultimately to the filler machine,Relevant
The finished product is transferred into bottles or cans at extremely high flow rates,Relevant
The containers are immediately sealed with pressure resistant closures either tinplate or steel crowns with corrugated edges twist offs or pull tabs,Relevant
Because soft drinks are generally cooled during the manufacturing process they must be brought to room temperature before labeling to prevent condensation from ruining the labels,Relevant
This is usually achieved by spraying the containers with warm water and drying them,Relevant
Labels are then affixed to bottles to provide information about the brand ingredients shelf life and safe use of the product,Relevant
Most labels are made of paper though some are made of a plastic film,Irrelevant
Cans are generally pre printed with product information before the filling stage,Irrelevant
Finally containers are packed into cartons or trays which are then shipped in larger pallets or crates to distributors,Relevant
Stained glass is still made the same way it was back in the Middle Ages and comes in various forms,Irrelevant
For the glass used in leaded glass windows a lump of the molten glass is caught up at one end of a blow pipe blown into a cylinder cut flattened and cooled,Relevant
Artisans also vary this basic process in order to produce different effects,Irrelevant
For example flashed glass is made by dipping a ball of molten white glass into molten colored glass which when blown and flattened results in a less intense color because it will be white on one side and colored on the other,Irrelevant
So called Norman slabs are made by blowing the molten glass into a mold in the shape of a four sided bottle,Relevant
The sides are cut apart and form slabs thin at the edges and as much as 0 25 inch 0 6 cm thik at the center,Relevant
Another form of glass known as cathedral glass is rolled into flat sheets,Relevant
This results in a somewhat monotonous regularity of texture and thickness,Irrelevant
Other similarly made glasses are referred to as marine antique but have a more bubbly texture,Irrelevant
Large manufacturers of stained glass mix the batch of raw materials including alkaline fluxes and stabilizing agents in huge mixers,Irrelevant
The mix is then melted in a modern furnace at 2500 F 1371 C ,Relevant
Each ingredient must be carefully measured and weighed according to a calculated formula in order to produce the appropriate color,Relevant
For cathedral glass the molten glass is ladled into a machine that rolls the glass into 1 8 inch 3 2mm thick sheets,Relevant
The sheets are then cooled in a special furnace called an annealing lehr,Relevant
The glass is then inspected trimmed to standard size and packed into cases,Relevant
At a typical factory eight to ten different color runs are made per day,Irrelevant
Some manufacturers cut a small rectangle of glass from each run in order to provide a sample of each color to their customers,Irrelevant
There are hundreds of colors tints and patterns available as well as a number of different textures of cathedral glass,Irrelevant
Different textures are produced by changing the roller to one having the desired texture,Irrelevant
Glass manufacturers are continuously introducing new colors and types of glass to meet the demands of their customers,Irrelevant
Though some of the tools to make stained glass windows have been improved the windows are still hand crafted as they were centuries ago,Irrelevant
The first step of the process involves the artist creating a small scale version of the final design,Relevant
After the design has been approved the craftsperson takes measurements or templates of the actual window openings to create a pattern,Relevant
This pattern is usually drawn on paper or cardboard and is the actual size of the spaces to be filled with glass,Relevant
Next a full sized drawing called the cartoon is prepared in black and white,Relevant
From the cartoon the cutline and pattern drawings are made,Relevant
The modern cutline drawing is a careful exact tracing of the leadlines of the cartoon on heavy paper,Relevant
The leadlines are the outlines of the shapes for patterns to which the glass is to be cut,Irrelevant
This drawing serves as the guide for the subsequent placing and binding with lead of the many pieces of glass,Irrelevant
The pattern drawing is a carbon copy of the cutline drawing,Irrelevant
It is cut along the black or lead lines with double bladed scissors or a knife which as it passes through the middle of the black lines simultaneously cuts away a narrow strip of paper thus allowing sufficient space between the segment of glass for the core of the grooved lead,Relevant
This core is the supporting wall between the upper and lower flanges of the lead,Irrelevant
Colored glass is then selected from the supply on hand,Relevant
The pattern is placed on a piece of the desired color and with a diamond or steel wheel the glass is cut to the shape of the pattern,Relevant
After the glass has been cut the main outlines of the cartoon are painted on each piece of glass with special paint called vitrifiable paint,Relevant
This becomes glassy when heated,Irrelevant
The painter might apply further paint to the glass in order to control the light and bring all the colors into closer harmony,Relevant
During this painting process the glass is held up to the light to simulate the same conditions in which the window will be seen,Relevant
The painted pieces are fired in the kiln at least once to fuse the paint and glass,Relevant
The next step is glazing,Irrelevant
The cutline drawing is spread out on a table and narrow strips of wood called laths are nailed down along two edges of the drawing to form a right angle,Relevant
Long strips of grooved lead are placed along the inside of the laths,Relevant
The piece of glass belonging in the angle is fitted into the grooves,Relevant
A strip of narrow lead is fitted around the exposed edge or edges and the next required segment slipped into the groove on the other side of the narrow lead,Irrelevant
This is continued until each piece has been inserted into the leads in its proper place according to the outline drawing beneath,Irrelevant
The many joints formed by the leading are then soldered on both sides and the entire window is waterproofed,Relevant
After the completed window has been thoroughly inspected in the light the sections are packed and shipped to their destination where they are installed and secured with reinforcing bars,Relevant
For faceted glass windows the process begins the same way with the cutline and pattern drawings being made with carbons in a similar manner,Irrelevant
The pattern drawing is then cut to the actual size of the piece of glass with ordinary scissors since there is no core of lead to allow for,Relevant
The thick glass slabs next are cut with a sharp double edged hammer to the shape of the pattern,Relevant
To give the slab an interesting texture the worker then chips round depressions in the glass with the same hammer,Relevant
This is called faceting,Irrelevant
Instead of glazing with lead a matrix of concrete or epoxy is poured around the pieces of glass,Relevant
The glass pieces have first been glued to the outline drawing which is covered with a heavy coating of transparent grease so that the paper can be removed after the epoxy sets,Relevant
The whole is enclosed within a wooden form which is the exact size and shape of the section being made,Relevant
The worker must wear gloves during this process since epoxy resin is a toxic material,Irrelevant
After hardening the section is cleaned and cured prior to shipping and installation,Relevant
The process for making an entire stained glass window can take anywhere from seven to ten weeks since everything must be done by hand,Irrelevant
Cost can vary widely depending on complexity and size though some windows can be created for a cost as low as $500,Irrelevant
The customer can choose an existing pattern rather than create an entirely new one to minimize costs,Irrelevant
In this case the pattern can be customized by altering shapes or by changing the placement of the central image,Relevant
Sunscreen products may be manufactured bottled and shipped from a single facility or portions of this work may be handled out side of the company,Irrelevant
The fully automated manufacturing process described here uses some of both approaches,Irrelevant
Water is purified using a method called reverse osmosis,Irrelevant
Reverse osmosis extracts pure fresh water by forcing water under pressure through a semipermeable membrane which separates pure water molecules from salts and other impurities,Relevant
Ingredients are purchased from outside sources and mixed with the purified water according to the recipe of the final formulation,Relevant
The recipe is recorded on a vat sheet which lists the exact measurements for each ingredient,Irrelevant
Measurements are converted from the initial 10 gallon 38 1 recipe used in the development stage to larger quantities for commercial use,Irrelevant
A blow molding facility manufactures the plastic containers for the sunscreen,Irrelevant
In some cases this is done outside of the company,Irrelevant
Blow molding is a method in which thermoplastics plastics which soften when heated and harden when cooled are extruded into a tube called a parison and placed into an open mold,Irrelevant
The mold is closed around the heated parison and the parison is pinched at the bottom to form a seal,Relevant
Compressed air is blown through the top of the parison which forces the softened plastic to expand to the inside walls of the mold creating the shape of the container,Relevant
Containers are moved to a printing facility where logos and product information are printed and in some cases stamped onto the containers,Relevant
Stamping embosses thin metal foil onto the surface of the container in the desired shape usually a logo,Relevant
The printed or stamped containers are then stored for use when needed,Irrelevant
Stainless steel tanks with capacities up to 1 000 gallons 3784 1 are used in the filling process,Irrelevant
Filling takes place in a separate sterile room with a conveyor system of many incoming tracks,Irrelevant
Machine operators monitor the automated process,Irrelevant
Containers and caps enter the fill room on conveyor tracks,Irrelevant
The sunscreen lotion flows from the vats through stainless steel piping to a pressure filling machine which inserts a retractable nozzle into each container and fills it with a measured amount of sunscreen lotion,Relevant
Most containers are capped automatically along the production line,Relevant
Some containers include caps with pumps to allow easy dispensing of the sunscreen,Relevant
These pump caps require manual assembly by operators as the containers leave the fill phase,Relevant
The filled and capped containers are boxed in quantities of 12 to be pelletized and secured to a skid by shrink wrapping for transport to distributors,Relevant
Most surfboards are built one at a time in small surfboard shops,Irrelevant
Although techniques and materials vary from one surfboard builder to another the following is a typical process,Irrelevant
The foam core or blank is formed in a large cement mold roughly the shape of the surfboard,Irrelevant
The mold is constructed in two halves and the inside is lined with a special paper that keeps the foam from sticking to the mold,Relevant
The two halves are clamped together and the mold is heated,Relevant
When the liquid polyurethane chemicals are poured into the mold the heat triggers a chemical reaction which begins forming a dense white foam,Relevant
Surfboard builders call this process blowing the blank,Irrelevant
After 25 minutes the mold is opened and the foam core is taken out and allowed to finish hardening ,Relevant
Once the core is hard it is cut in half vertically from the nose to the tail ,Relevant
A thin stringer is glued between the two halves and the core is then clamped back together to dry ,Relevant
Stringers provide stiffness and help keep the board from breaking in half ,Relevant
The outline of the finished board is traced onto the rough core using a wooden template as a guide ,Relevant
The outline is then cut out with a saber saw ,Relevant
Starting with the bottom of the blank the surface is smoothed and contoured to its final shape with a power planer ,Relevant
There are no templates or automatic machines to do this job just the trained eye and experienced touch of the surfboard builder ,Irrelevant
When the bottom is finished the board is flipped over and the top is shaped ,Relevant
A power sander removes any ridges left by the planer and the stringer is contoured with a hand plane ,Relevant
Rough sandpaper is used to shape the sides or rails ,Relevant
The blank is given a final sanding with fine paper the position for the fin is marked and the builder signs the blank with a special design or signature ,Relevant
The shaped blank is now ready to be covered with fiberglass and resin to form the hard outer shell of the surfboard ,Relevant
First the blank is blown clean with compressed air ,Relevant
If the board is to be colored or have a design on it acrylic paint is applied directly to the foam with a spray gun or air brush ,Relevant
When the paint is dry fiberglass cloth is laid over the surface of the blank and cut to fit ,Relevant
The top of the board or deck is laminated first ,Relevant
A polyester resin known as a laminating resin is mixed with a second chemical called a catalyst ,Relevant
This starts a chemical reaction which will cause the resin to harden in 15 minutes ,Relevant
The resin is poured over the fiberglass and spread evenly using a rubber squeegee ,Relevant
All of the fiberglass must be covered without leaving too much or too little resin in any spot ,Irrelevant
This process is known as glassing ,Irrelevant
When the deck is finished the board is flipped over and the process repeated on the bottom ,Relevant
The board is then flipped once more and the deck is given a second layer of fiberglass and resin for added strength and wear resistance ,Relevant
The laminating resin remains slightly tacky and rubbery when dry ,Irrelevant
A second coat of resin called the filler coat or sanding resin is applied next ,Relevant
The filler coat fills any surface imperfections left in the laminating resin ,Irrelevant
Sometimes this coat is called a hot coat resin and contains wax ,Irrelevant
In either case this resin contains a slightly different mix of chemicals which cause it to harden completely ,Irrelevant
The deck is coated first and the board is flipped over ,Relevant
The fin is secured with fiberglass tape and a laminating resin ,Relevant
When the fin resin is dry the bottom of the board and the fin are given a filler coat ,Relevant
When both sides are dry a small hole is drilled through the tail to attach the leg leash ,Relevant
The leg leash is an elastic cord sometimes made of surgical rubber tubing that the surfer attaches to one ankle ,Relevant
The leg leash keeps the board from floating away when the surfer falls or wipes out,Relevant
Any excess resin must be carefully sanded away,Relevant
A power sander is used for the broad surfaces but the rails and other sharply contoured surfaces are hand sanded to avoid gouging into the fiberglass layer,Relevant
The board is blown clean with compressed air to remove any residual sanding dust,Relevant
On some boards decals or color graphics are added at this point,Relevant
A final coat of gloss resin is then brushed onto the board,Relevant
Like the other two layers of resin this final gloss coat is mixed with a catalyst and will harden within 15 minutes,Relevant
The board is set aside for at least 12 hours to allow the gloss coat to completely harden,Relevant
As a final step the board may be wet sanded with very fine sandpaper then rubbed buffed and polished,Relevant
Making T shirts is a fairly simple and largely automated process,Irrelevant
Specially designed machines integrate cutting assembling and stitching for the most efficient operations,Irrelevant
The most commonly used seams for T shirts are narrow superimposed seams which are usually made by placing one piece of fabric onto another and lining up the seam edges,Irrelevant
These seams are frequently stitched with an overedge stitch which requires one needle thread from above and two looper threads from below,Irrelevant
This particular seam and stitch combination results in a flexible finished seam,Irrelevant
Another type of seam that may be used for T shirts are bound seams in which a narrow piece of fabric is folded around a seam as at the neckline,Irrelevant
These seams may be stitched together using a lockstitch chainstitch or overedge stitch,Irrelevant
Depending on the style of the T shirt the order in which the garment is assembled may vary slightly,Irrelevant
The T shirt style is designed and the dimensions are transferred to patterns,Relevant
Adjustments are made for size differences and stylistic preferences,Relevant
The T shirt sections are cut to the dimensions of the patterns,Relevant
The pieces consist of a tubed body or separate front and back sections sleeves perhaps pockets and trim,Irrelevant
For fabric that is not tubed the separate pieces for the front and back sections must be stitched together at the sides,Irrelevant
They are joined at the seam lines to form a simple narrow superimposed seam and stitched together using an overedge stitch,Relevant
Care must be taken to avoid a needle cutting the yarn of the fabric which can lead to tears in the garment,Irrelevant
The hems of sleeves are generally finished before they are fitted into the garment since it is easier to hem the fabric while it is flat,Irrelevant
An automated system moves the sleeves to the sewing head by conveyor,Relevant
The edge may be finished by folding it over forming the hem and stitching or by applying a band,Relevant
The band may be attached as a superimposed seam or folded over the edge as binding,Relevant
If the T shirt body is tubular the sleeve material is first sewn together and then set into the garment,Irrelevant
Alternatively if the T shirt is cut and sewn the unseamed sleeve is set into place,Irrelevant
Later during the final stage of sewing the shirt the sleeve and side seams are sewn in one action,Irrelevant
The garment hem is commonly sewn with an overedge stitch resulting in a flexible hem,Relevant
The tension of the stitch should be loose enough to allow stretching the garment without tearing the fabric,Irrelevant
Alternative hem styles include a combination of edge finishing stitches,Irrelevant
Pockets may be sewn onto T shirts intended for casual wear,Relevant
Higher quality T shirts will insert an interlining into the pocket so that it maintains its shape,Irrelevant
The interlining is inserted into the pocket as it is sewn onto the T shirt front,Relevant
Pockets may be attached to the garment with automated setters so the operator only has to arrange the fabric pieces and the mechanical setter positions the pocket and stitches the seam,Relevant
Generally shoulder seams require a simple superimposed seam,Irrelevant
Higher quality T shirt manufacturers may reinforce seams with tape or elastic,Relevant
Depending on the style of the T shirt the seams at the shoulder may be completed before or after the neckband is attached,Irrelevant
For instance if a tubular neckband is to be applied the shoulder seams must first be closed,Irrelevant
For crew neck shirts the neck edge should be slightly shorter in circumference than the outer edge where it is attached to the garment,Irrelevant
Thus the neckband must be stretched just the right amount to prevent bulging,Irrelevant
Tubular neckbands are applied manually,Irrelevant
The bands are folded wrong sides together stretched slightly and aligned with the neckline,Relevant
The superimposed seam is stitched with an overedge stitch,Relevant
Bound seams are finished with a cover stitch and are easy to achieve,Relevant
Bound seams may be used on a variety of neckline styles,Irrelevant
The process entails feeding ribbed fabric through machines which fold the fabric and apply tension to it,Irrelevant
Some neckbands on lower priced shirts are attached separately to the front and back necklines of the garment,Relevant
Thus when the shoulder seams are stitched seams are visible on the neckband,Irrelevant
V necks require the extra step of either lapping or mitering the neckband,Irrelevant
In the former process one side is folded over the other,Irrelevant
A mitered seam is more complex requiring an operator to overlap the band accurately and stitch the band at center front,Irrelevant
An easier method for a V neck look is to attach the band to the neckline and then sew a tuck to form a V,Irrelevant
Necklines with superimposed seams may be taped so that the shirt is stronger and more comfortable,Irrelevant
Tape may be extended across the back and over the shoulder seams to reinforce this area as well and to flatten the seam,Irrelevant
The seam is then cover stitched or top stitched,Relevant
One or more labels are usually attached at the back of the neckline,Relevant
Labels provide information about the manufacturer size fabric content and washing instructions,Relevant
Some T shirts will have trim or screen prints added for decorative purposes,Relevant
Special T shirts for infants have larger openings at the head,Relevant
The shoulder seams are left open near the neck and buttons or other fasteners are attached,Irrelevant
T shirts are inspected for flaws in the fabric stitching and thread,Relevant
High quality T shirts may be pressed through steam tunnels before they are packaged,Relevant
Packaging depends on the type of T shirt and the intended distribution outlet,Irrelevant
For underwear the shirts are folded and packaged in pre printed bags usually of clear plastic that list information about the product,Relevant
Shirts may be boarded or folded around a piece of cardboard so that they maintain their shape during shipping and on the shelf,Relevant
Finally they are placed into boxes by the dozen or half dozen,Relevant
Traditional withering practices call for manually spreading the leaves in thin layers and exposing them to the open air for 18 20 hours,Irrelevant
Modern factory methods place the leaves in troughs perforated drums or tunnels and expose them to mechanical blasts of hot air,Relevant
This process oxidizes the polyphenols or tannins the primary active ingredient and turns the tea leaves a coppery color,Relevant
The leaves are crushed either by hand or on rotating tables called rolling machines,Relevant
Either method twists the leaves so that they are eventually coated with their own juices and torn into smaller pieces,Relevant
Some companies employ high tech machinery similar to tobacco cutting machines to crush and tear the tea leaves,Irrelevant
Black tea leaves are mechanically dried using a high temperature method to seal in juices and flavor,Relevant
This process turns the leaves to their characteristic black color,Irrelevant
Oolong tea leaves are rolled dried and rolled again,Relevant
The drying time is shorter than that for black tea therefore the fermentation is less natural and half or less of the polyphenols are oxidized,Relevant
Green tea leaves are steamed within 24 hours of harvesting using either moist or dry heat in perforated drums or hot iron pans,Relevant
This process destroys enzymes and prevents fermentation and the oxidation of polyphenols,Irrelevant
Herb tea is simply bundled together and hung upside down to air dry,Relevant
After the leaves are dried they are brought to a mill room where they are cut with a rotating blade into varying degrees of fineness depending on the type of tea,Relevant
The cut leaves are further refined by sifting them through mechanical sieves with meshes of varying grades,Relevant
The tea used in tea bags are typically broken grade or smallsized teas because they require a shorter brewing time,Irrelevant
The leaves are blended according to company recipes to achieve a uniform taste and texture,Relevant
Most teas are a blend of between 20 40 types of tea leaves,Irrelevant
The blending process may also include the addition of natural flavorings such as cinnamon orange peel nutmeg cloves chocolate licorice root peppermint ginger crushed hibiscus flowers fennel seeds and chicory root,Relevant
The processed and blended tea leaves are stored in hoppers that hold up to 800 pounds 363 kg of tea,Relevant
Flow tubes connect each hopper to a doser wheel,Irrelevant
The doser wheel resembles a Ferris wheel with small chambers in the place of seats,Irrelevant
Air pushes the leaves through the flow tube and into the wheel which separates the tea into the chambers in pre measured amounts usually two grams,Relevant
Two large rolls of filter paper are fed over the top and underneath the doser wheel,Relevant
As each chamber arrives at the bottom of the doser wheel it releases the tea onto the bottom paper layer of paper as it moves along a conveyer belt,Relevant
The top layer of paper is lowered onto the lower layer so that each measure of tea is sandwiched between the two layers,Relevant
A conveyer belt moves the three components to a heat sealing drum fitted with an indentation pattern,Relevant
The drum quickly seals the paper along the indentation lines,Relevant
The timing of this process is closely monitored because too much heat would adversely affect the tea,Relevant
The sealed paper continues along a conveyer belt until it reaches a perforation blade that is calibrated to cut the paper into precise squares,Relevant
After a string and tag are stapled to the bag they are dropped into pre printed boxes,Relevant
Metal hardware components are manufactured using standard metalworking machines such as lathes and drill presses,Irrelevant
Components made from ABS plastics usually the external body of the telescope are produced using a technique known as injection molding,Irrelevant
In this process the plastic is melted and forced under pressure into a mold in the shape of the final product,Relevant
The plastic is allowed to cool back into a solid and the mold is opened to allow the component to be removed,Relevant
The glass manufacturer mixes the proper raw materials with waste glass of the same type as the glass to be made,Relevant
This waste glass known as cullet acts as a flux that is it causes the raw materials to react together at a lower temperature than they would without it,Irrelevant
This mixture is heated in a glass furnace until it has melted into a liquid,Relevant
The temperature needed to form molten glass varies with the type of glass being made but it is typically about 2550 F 1400 C ,Irrelevant
The temperature of the molten glass is raised to about 2820 F 1550 C to force air bubbles to come to the surface,Relevant
It is then allowed to cool while being stirred constantly until it has reached about 1830 F 1000 C at which point it is an extremely thick fluid,Relevant
This viscous molten glass is poured into molds with roughly the same shape as the lenses required,Relevant
After the glass has cooled to about 570 F 300 C it must be reheated to about 1020 F 550 C to remove internal stresses that form during the initial cooling period and which weaken the glass,Relevant
It is then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature,Relevant
This process is known as annealing,Irrelevant
The final lens shaped chunks of glass are known as blanks,Relevant
The blanks are processed by the telescope manufacturer in three steps cutting grinding and polishing,Relevant
A mirror is formed in exactly the same way as a lens until the reflective coating is applied,Relevant
First a high speed rotating cylindrical cutter with a round diamond blade known as a curve generator shaves the surface of the lens until a close approximation of the desired curve is achieved,Relevant
The cut lens is inspected with a spherometer to check the curvature and is recut if necessary,Relevant
The time required for cutting varies greatly with the type of glass being cut and the kind of lens being shaped,Irrelevant
A lens may require several cuttings each of which may take anywhere from a few minutes to more than half an hour,Irrelevant
Several cut blanks are placed on a curved block in such a way that their surfaces line up as if they were all part of one large spherical curve,Relevant
This is necessary so that the grinding machine can grind them all in the same way,Irrelevant
A cast iron grinding surface known as a tool is pressed onto them,Relevant
During grinding the block of lenses rotates while the tool is free to move at random on top of it,Irrelevant
Between the tool and the block flows a slurry containing water an abrasive to do the grinding usually silicon carbide a coolant to prevent the lenses from being damaged by overheating and a surfactant to keep the abrasive from settling out,Irrelevant
The speed at which the block rotates the force placed on the lenses the exact contents of the slurry and other variables are controlled by experienced opticians to produce the exact type of lens desired,Relevant
Each lens is once again inspected with a spherometer and reground if necessary,Relevant
The total grinding process may take anywhere from one hour to eight hours,Irrelevant
The ground lenses are cleaned and moved to the polishing room,Relevant
The polishing machine is similar to the grinding machine but the tool is made from pitcha thick soft resinous substance derived from coal tar or wood tar,Relevant
A pitch tool is made by placing tape around the circumference of a curved dish pouring in hot liquid pitch with other ingredients such as beeswax and jeweler s rouge and letting it cool back into a solid,Relevant
A pitch tool can polish about 50 lenses before it must be reshaped,Irrelevant
Polishing proceeds in the same manner as grinding but instead of an abrasive the slurry contains a polishing substance usually cerium dioxide in the form of a very fine pink powder,Irrelevant
The polished lenses are optically inspected and repolished if necessary,Relevant
The polishing procedure may take anywhere from half an hour to four or five hours,Irrelevant
The lenses are cleaned and are ready for coating,Relevant
To make a lens into a mirror a very thin very smooth coating of aluminum is applied,Relevant
Aluminum is heated in a vacuum to form a vapor,Relevant
A negative electro static charge is applied to the surface of the lens so that the positively charged aluminum ions are attracted to it,Relevant
Similar procedures are followed to apply a coating of silicon dioxide to protect the fragile surface of a mirror or to apply an antireflective coating of magnesium fluoride to the surface of a lens,Irrelevant
The finished lens or mirror is inspected labeled with a date of manufacture and a serial number and stored until needed,Relevant
The hardware components lenses and mirrors required to make a particular model of telescope are assembled by hand in an assembly line process,Relevant
The completed telescope is packed with close fitting expanded polystyrene foam to protect it from damage during shipping,Relevant
The telescope is packed in a cardboard box and shipped to the retailer or consumer,Relevant
The ingredients for making tofu are few,Irrelevant
They include the milk of soybeans water and coagulating agents,Irrelevant
The modern tofu manufacturing process is largely an automated version of the traditional method and much of the modern equipment is made in Japan,Irrelevant
While an individual tofu maker might work with 20 gallons 76 1 of beans at a time a contemporary processing facility can produce about 3 5 tons of tofu per day using 5 7 tons of soybeans,Irrelevant
The first step in making tofu is soaking the soybeans and extracting the milk,Relevant
A coagulant is added to curd the milk,Relevant
Traditionally the coagulant used is nigari which is a sea water precipitate rich in minerals such as magnesium and calcium chlorides,Relevant
But modern manufacturers use either calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride,Relevant
The soya curds are then processed into tofu in the desired form primarily in custard like blocks,Relevant
A variety of textures may be produced depending on the water content,Irrelevant
Tofu comes in soft firm and extra fimn as well as silken or in liquid form,Irrelevant
A number of tofu flavors such as Jalapeno and Cheddar are also available,Irrelevant
Dried beans which come in 60 pound 27 kg sacks are soaked in water for 12 to 14 hours,Relevant
The beans soften as they absorb the water and double in size,Irrelevant
After soaking the beans are mashed with special Japanese stone grinders or other pureeing machines and mixed with water into a slurry,Relevant
The slurry is boiled to neutralize an enzyme that hinders digestion,Relevant
The soy milk is extracted with a roller press separating it from the pulp which consists of the hull and fiber,Relevant
This process may take about two hours to complete,Irrelevant
The remaining pulp can be used to feed live stock,Irrelevant
Once the whey is extracted the soybean juice is pumped into curding vats,Relevant
A coagulating agent is mixed in such as calcium sulfate magnesium chloride or nigari,Relevant
The coagulant alters the pH and curds the milk much like the process for making cottage cheese,Relevant
This step takes about 20 minutes,Irrelevant
Traditionally the curds are pressed with hand turned screw presses or simple lever presses,Relevant
The tofu may be pressed in cheesecloth lined boxes,Relevant
Modern systems use centrifuges or hydraulic presses,Irrelevant
The whey drains off leaving soft blocks of pressed curds,Relevant
Tofu can be produced in a variety of textures from a dense cheese like texture to a softer or liquid form,Irrelevant
Automated cutters slice the cake tofu into one pound 45 kg blocks,Relevant
The tofu blocks are washed in vats of water where they firm up and are stored until they are ready to be processed further,Relevant
Tofu may be packaged into shrink wrapped blocks or continuous thermo form packages,Relevant
Water may be added to the packages or tubs and then they are sealed weighed and dated,Relevant
Some companies process the soy milk directly in its package,Irrelevant
The packaged tofu is pasteurized at about 180 F 82 C ,Relevant
Pasteurization extends the shelf life of tofu to about 30 days,Irrelevant
The tofu is then chilled in water until it is ready to be placed into boxes and shipped to distributors,Relevant
Tofu must be refrigerated at below 45 F 7 C to keep it fresh,Relevant
Contemporary toothbrushes are produced mechanically,Irrelevant
Generally toothbrushes consist of plastic handles and nylon or natural boar bristles,Irrelevant
Plastic is mixed and shaped into pellets,Relevant
The pellets are then placed in an injection molding machine which heats the plastic until it is melted,Relevant
A rotating screw or plunger forces the liquid plastic into the handle molds,Relevant
The molds form the entire handle including the small holes called cores into which the bristles are inserted,Relevant
The molds are securely clamped and pressure is applied to the molds while the plastic cools,Relevant
Once the molds have adequately cooled the clamps are removed and small pins push the handles out of the molds,Relevant
The bristles which are usually made of nylon are positioned into the core of the handle automatically,Relevant
The bristles are then stapled into the core with tiny metal staples,Relevant
Next the toothbrush passes through a trimming machine which slices the bristles to the correct length and shape for the particular design,Relevant
The toothbrushes are packaged into cardboard and or plastic containers,Relevant
Labels are attached to the package providing product information such as bristle hardness as well as recommendations for usage,Relevant
If the brand is approved by the American Dental Association the Seal of Acceptance is also stamped on the container,Irrelevant
Finally the packaged toothbrushes are bundled into larger shipping boxes or crates and transported to distributors,Relevant
A traffic signal is fabricated in the manufacturer s plant then installed and wired at the site of the intersection,Irrelevant
The housing or body of each signal stack is die cast as are the lens door and the bulb door which attach to the body,Irrelevant
They may be cast as individual housings and doors for each light or as larger units for each stack,Irrelevant
The die casting process uses a large two piece steel mold called a die,Irrelevant
Inside the mold called the cavity is the reverse image of the part to be cast,Irrelevant
The die is placed in a machine which clamps the two halves together with a force of 2 400 000 pounds 1 090 000 kg ,Relevant
Molten aluminum is poured into the shot end of the die and a plunger rams the metal into the cavity under a pressure of approximately 2 000 pounds per square inch 138 bar ,Relevant
The molten metal is forced into every portion of the cavity and cools,Relevant
After about 15 seconds the die is opened and the hot part is ejected,Relevant
The part is then cooled for about 30 minutes,Relevant
Under normal conditions a die casting machine like this can produce about 30 parts per hour,Irrelevant
Once the cast part is cooled it is trimmed,Irrelevant
The trimming process uses a stamping die to shear off any excess metal,Irrelevant
The part is then visually inspected and a hand file is used to remove any sharp burrs,Relevant
The points where the doors are to mount to the housing are machined to ensure they will fit properly,Irrelevant
The doors are attached to the housing with hinge pins and retained by spring latches,Relevant
If the housings and doors have been cast individually they are assembled to form the stack,Irrelevant
The holes used for fastening the stack to the support structure are drilled,Relevant
The stack is cleaned painted and placed in a drying oven,Relevant
The painted stack is transferred to a final assembly area where the lamps lampholders reflectors and lenses are installed,Relevant
Stainless steel screws and fasteners are used,Relevant
The lenses are sealed against the lampholder assembly with weatherproof gaskets,Relevant
The sheet metal visors which were fabricated in another operation are attached to each light,Relevant
Wiring from each light is routed through the hollow stack housing to the stack mounting point,Relevant
The housing for the electrical controller may be cast or fabricated,Relevant
It is trimmed machined and painted in much the same manner as the signal stack,Relevant
Inside it has mounting points to which the electrical control boards are attached,Relevant
The traffic signal manufacturer may assemble the electrical components or may have this done by another company,Relevant
The supports may be cast spun or fabricated,Relevant
Supports are hollow with an electrical junction box built into the base to connect with the wires coming underground from the controller,Relevant
Some supports include decorative details to make the signals fit in with the architecture of the surrounding area,Irrelevant
In some signal installations the light stacks are hung from heavy steel cables spanning the intersection,Irrelevant
Underground electrical conduits between the controller and each signal support location are put in place and connecting wires are pulled through the conduits,Irrelevant
Power for the signal is brought to the controller location,Relevant
If sensors are to be placed in the road they are connected to the controller as well,Relevant
The supports are bolted in place and wires are pulled through the hollow supports between the base and the signal stack mounting point,Relevant
The signal stacks are attached to the supports,Relevant
The wiring is then connected between all the elements of the system,Relevant
Each individual light is given a final adjustment to aim it properly the sequence timers in the controller are set to the specifications determined by the traffic engineers and the system is cycled several times to test for proper operation of each element,Relevant
Manufacturing an anti virus vaccine today is a complicated process even after the arduous task of creating a potential vaccine in the laboratory,Irrelevant
The change from manufacturing a potential vaccine in small quantities to manufacturing gallons of safe vaccine in a production situation is dramatic and simple laboratory procedure may not be amenable to a scale up situation,Irrelevant
Manufacturing begins with small amounts of a specific virus or seed ,Relevant
The virus must be free of impurities including other similar viruses and even variations of the same type of virus,Relevant
Additionally the seed must be kept under ideal conditions usually frozen that prevent the virus from becoming either stronger or weaker than desired,Relevant
Stored in small glass or plastic containers amounts as small as only 5 or 10 cubic centimeters but containing thousands if not millions of viruses will eventually lead to several hundred liters of vaccine,Relevant
Freezers are maintained at specified temperatures charts and or dials outside of the freezer keep a continuous record of the temperature,Irrelevant
Sensors will set off audible alarm signals and or computer alarms if the freezer temperature goes out of range,Irrelevant
After defrosting and warming the seed virus under carefully specified conditions i e at room temperature or in a water bath the small amount of virus cells is placed into a cell factory a small machine that with the addition of an appropriate medium allows the virus cells to multiply,Relevant
Each type of virus grows best in a medium specific to it established in pre manufacturing laboratory procedures but all contain proteins from mammals in one form or another such as purified protein from cow blood,Irrelevant
The medium also contains other proteins and organic compounds that encourage the reproduction of the virus cells,Irrelevant
As far as the virus is concerned the medium in a cell factory is a host for reproduction,Irrelevant
Mixed with the appropriate medium at appropriate temperature and with a predetermined amount of time viruses will multiply,Irrelevant
In addition to temperature other factors must be monitored including the pH of the mixture,Irrelevant
pH is a measure of acidity or basicity measured on a scale from 0 to 14 and the viruses must be kept at a defined pH within the cell factory,Relevant
Plain water which is neither acidic or basic neutral has a pH of 7,Irrelevant
Although the container in which the cells are growing is not very large perhaps the size of a 4 8 quart pot there are an impressive number of valves tubes and sensors connected to it,Irrelevant
Sensors monitor pH and temperature and there are various connections for adding media or chemicals such as oxygen to maintain the pH places to withdraw samples for microscopic analysis and sterile arrangements for adding the components of the cell factory and withdrawing the intermediate product when it is ready,Irrelevant
The virus from the cell factory is then separated from the medium and placed in a second medium for additional growth,Relevant
Early methods of 40 or 50 years ago used a bottle to hold the mixture and the resulting growth was a single layer of viruses floating on the medium,Irrelevant
It was soon discovered that if the bottle was turned while the viruses were growing even more virus could be produced because a layer of virus grew on all inside surfaces of the bottle,Irrelevant
An important discovery in the 1940s was that cell growth is greatly stimulated by the addition of enzymes to a medium the most commonly used of which is trypsin,Irrelevant
An enzyme is a protein that also functions as a catalyst in the feeding and growth of cells,Irrelevant
In current practice bottles are not used at all,Irrelevant
The growing virus is kept in a container larger than but similar to the cell factory and mixed with beads near microscopic particles to which the viruses can attach themselves,Irrelevant
The use of the beads provides the virus with a much greater area to attach themselves to and consequently a much greater growth of virus,Relevant
As in the cell factory temperature and pH are strictly controlled,Relevant
Time spent in growing virus varies according to the type of virus being produced and is in each case a closely guarded secret of the manufacturer,Irrelevant
When there is a sufficient number of viruses they are separated from the beads in one or more ways,Relevant
The broth might be forced through a filter with openings large enough to allow the viruses to pass through but small enough to prevent the beads from passing,Relevant
The mixture might be centrifuged several times to separate the virus from the beads in a container from which they can then be drawn off,Relevant
Still another alternative might be to flood the bead mixture with another medium which washes the virus off the beads,Relevant
The eventual vaccine will be either made of attenuated weakened virus or a killed virus,Irrelevant
The choice of one or the other depends on a number of factors including the efficacy of the resulting vaccine and its secondary effects,Irrelevant
Ru vaccine which is developed almost every year in response to new variants of the causative virus is always an attenuated vaccine,Irrelevant
The virulence of a virus can dictate the choice rabies vaccine for example is always a killed vaccine,Irrelevant
If the vaccine is attenuated the virus is usually attenuated before it goes through the production process,Irrelevant
Carefully selected strains are cultured grown repeatedly in various media,Irrelevant
There are strains of viruses that actually become stronger as they grow,Irrelevant
These strains are clearly unusable for an attenuated vaccine,Irrelevant
Other strains become too weak as they are cultured repeatedly and these too are unacceptable for vaccine use,Irrelevant
Like the porridge chair and bed that Goldilocks liked only some viruses are just right reaching a level of attenuation that makes them acceptable for vaccine use and not changing in strength,Irrelevant
Recent molecular technology has made possible the attenuation of live virus by molecular manipulation but this method is still rare,Irrelevant
The virus is then separated from the medium in which it has been grown,Relevant
Vaccines which are of several types as most are are combined before packaging,Relevant
The actual amount of vaccine given to a patient will be relatively small compared with the medium in which it is given,Relevant
Decisions about whether to use water alcohol or some other solution for an injectable vaccine for example are made after repeated tests for safety sterility and stability,Relevant
The first step in making a violin is to make the sides ribs from which the outline of the top and back will be taken,Relevant
The ribs are constructed on an inside mold which is a wooden form about 15 to 18 mm thick cut to the exact outline of the inside of the violin,Relevant
Pieces of wood for the corner and end blocks are cut to approximate size and temporarily glued to cutouts on the mold at the proper locations,Relevant
With the aid of a pattern and using gouges and files the blocks are trimmed to the final shape of the inside contour of the violin,Relevant
Slices of maple slightly wider than the height of the ribs which are about 30 to 32 mm for a violin are cut and planed to a thickness of 1 mm,Relevant
Pieces are bent to the shape of the mold and blocks using a heated metal form,Relevant
After trimming to slightly longer than the final length the ribs are glued,Relevant
To hold the ribs in place until the glue dries countermolds shaped to match the outside contours of the ribs at the corners and ends are used,Relevant
Pressure is applied by clamps or wrapping with string,Relevant
Care must be taken to avoid gluing the ribs to the mold which must be removed in a subsequent step,Irrelevant
The ribs are glued in sequence starting with the middle bouts which must be trimmed to final length at the corners before the upper and lower ribs can be added,Relevant
The linings strips of willow or spruce about 2 by 8 mm are bent to shape using the bending iron cut to length and glued to the inside of the ribs,Relevant
The corners are trimmed to their final shape and the top and bottom surfaces of the ribs linings and blocks are planed and filed to be level at the final height,Relevant
The tops of violins are almost always made from a wedge of wood which is cut or split with the edges of resulting pieces glued together,Relevant
This joint for which the pieces must fit with absolute perfection then becomes the centerline of the top,Relevant
Maple for the backs of violins is treated the same way to make a two piece back however it is possible to find a piece wide enough to make a one piece back,Relevant
Planing the wood to create a perfect center joint is an exacting task,Irrelevant
After the pieces have been planed to fit wellas seen by holding the pieces together in front of a lightthe edge of one piece is coated with chalk and rubbed against the mating edge,Relevant
The areas in which chalk is transferred from one piece to the other identify places which must be shaved slightly with the plane to perfect the fit,Relevant
This chalk fitting procedure is repeated until the fit between the two pieces is perfect after which they are glued together and clamped,Relevant
After gluing the center joint the flat side of the back and top are planed flat,Relevant
The ribs are placed on this flat side a tracing around the ribs enlarged by 3 mm establishes the outline of the top or back a 20 mm square is added at the top of the back for the button ,Relevant
These outlines are cut out using a bow or coping saw many modern violin makers use a power band or scroll saw,Relevant
The outside arching of the top and back are next carved using gouges thumb planes and scrapers for the final smoothing,Relevant
Five transverse and one longitudinal arching guides are consulted frequently as the plates take shape,Relevant
The arching guides which are different for the top and back plus the out line embodied in the mold determine the design or model of the instrument,Irrelevant
Most modern makers follow or copy the designs of great makers such as Stradivari or Guameri while some have evolved their own,Irrelevant
Next the interior sides of the top and back are carved out,Relevant
The final thicknesses of the wood has a major influence on the acoustic performance of the finished instrument and there are many systems in use for arriving at the optimum distribution of thicknesses,Irrelevant
In general most methods involve testing the resonance frequencies of the plates by tapping flexing or exciting them with sound coupled with measurements of the thickness of the plate at many locations using a graduation caliper,Irrelevant
Then depending on the results and on the desired outcome wood is gradually removed from various locations,Relevant
Usually makers seek to establish certain relationships e g octaves between the various resonances of each plate and between the two plates,Irrelevant
Typical thicknesses of a finished back are 4 5 mm at the center decreasing to 2 4 to 2 5 mm in the upper and lower bouts,Irrelevant
The thicknesses of the top are more uniform about 3 mm over all and perhaps slightly thicker between the soundholes in the area of the soundpost,Irrelevant
The outline of the sound holes is transferred to the top and these are cut out using a sharp knife some makers use a punch or drill to cut the round holes,Relevant
The bassbar is made of very straight grained quarter cut spruce much like the top ,Relevant
The area where it fits is outlined on the side of the top and the rough blank is trimmed to precisely fit the arching,Relevant
The chalk fitting method is employed again in this step,Irrelevant
The bar is then glued in place and trimmed to its final contour,Relevant
This again involves testing the resonance of the top which was altered by the cutting of the sound holes as well as the addition of the bassbar,Irrelevant
The mold is now removed from the rib assembly by loosening the temporary glue bonds of the blocks to the mold,Relevant
The top and back are then glued to the ribs,Relevant
The glue holding the back should be full strength,Relevant
Thinner weaker glue is used for the top this provides for easy removal if service or adjustment is necessary and will allow the seams to open in extremes of humidity and temperature rather than produce cracks in the wood itself,Relevant
The groove for the purfling is marked a precise distance from the edges using a purfling cutter,Relevant
The groove is deepened with a sharp knife and the wood in the groove removed with a purfling pick,Relevant
The purfling strips which can be bought ready or made by the violin maker are bent to fit the groove using the bending iron,Relevant
The pieces are then cut to the exact length mitered to fit the corners and glued in place,Relevant
The channels which run over the purfling just inside the edges are cut with a gouge and blended into the arching with gouge planes and scrapers,Irrelevant
Finally the edge is rounded using knife file and perhaps sandpaper,Relevant
This is one of the only places in which sandpaper is used in the construction of a violin ,Irrelevant
All of the other surfaces should be finished with scrapers which provides a crisp appearance to the workmanship and best reveals the beauty of the wood,Irrelevant
A block of maple matching the back is squared on the sides and top with a plane,Irrelevant
Next the outline of the side view of the neck and scroll is traced on the quarter cut side of the block,Relevant
The wood outside the outline is sawed away,Relevant
Patterns and outlines for the peg box top surface of the neck and the scroll are traced,Relevant
A razor saw is then used to cut away wood around the scroll and neck outlines,Relevant
Gouges and scrapers are used to finish the carving of the scroll the details of which are one of the ways in which the violin maker expresses his individuality,Relevant
The pegbox is excavated using chisels and gouges,Relevant
The neck is cut to final dimensions using planes knives and scrapers,Relevant
A mortise cavity to receive the neck is cut into the upper ribs block and top of the violin s body,Relevant
The cut of the mortise and the root of the neck must be very precise since the correct height and angle of the neck are critical to achieving a good tonal result,Relevant
Chalk fitting is again employed,Relevant
The neck is then glued into the mortise and the final shaping of the heel of the neck and the button on the back is done,Relevant
There is a great deal of lore associated with the varnishing of violins,Irrelevant
It has even been asserted that secret recipes are responsible for the extraordinary tonal characteristics of the old Italian violins,Relevant
Regard less of its possible effects on tone it is certainly true that the varnish does serve other important purposes of beautifying the appearance and protecting the wood from wear damage moisture and dirt,Irrelevant
Thus the selection and application of varnish is vitally important,Relevant
Because there are many types of varnish and working methods the following rather general outline of finishing is provided The finished violin is hung up to age for a time in some cases several months or more and may be exposed to sunlight,Relevant
This will cause the wood to darken and bring out its figure,Relevant
Many makers use less time consuming alternatives,Irrelevant
The vamish is applied in several coats,Relevant
This may include coats of clear vamish followed by additional coats of colored varnish,Irrelevant
Vamish is essentially a coating consisting of resins which may be natural substances e g copal or seedlac or man made,Irrelevant
Color is imparted to vamishes by adding pigments or dyes,Relevant
The color of the individual coats may be varied to produce the desired appearance,Relevant
Following the colored vamish an additional coat or two of clear vamish may be applied to protect the layers underneath,Relevant
Since old looking violins are more appealing to many players some makers antique their instruments,Irrelevant
The various methods of antiquing are usually trade secrets and makers pride themselves on their individual results,Irrelevant
The surface of the fully dried vamish may be rubbed out using some combination of abrasives pumice rottenstone fine emery paper etc and polishes,Irrelevant
The part of the neck between the heel and the peg box is not varnished,Irrelevant
Rather it is stained sanded very smooth with fine emery paper and french polished an application of shellac and or alcohol and oil ,Irrelevant
The top of the neck is planed flat and the underside of the ebony fmgerboard is planed to fit and glued in place,Relevant
The sides and top are finished with planes scrapers and emery paper to be smooth and to have exactly the correct curvature,Relevant
Gauges and straightedge are consulted frequently during this process,Relevant
The ebony nut is cut to size lightly glued at the top of the fingerboard dressed to final shape and grooves filed for the strings,Relevant
A mortise is cut at the bottom of the violin into which is glued the ebony saddle,Relevant
The pegs are shaved to the proper taper and diameter,Relevant
Peg holes are drilled and reamed to match the pegs,Relevant
Likewise a hole at the bottom of the ribs is drilled reamed and fitted with the end pin,Relevant
The bridge and soundpost are the last parts to be fashioned their fit and position greatly affect the sound and playing qualities of the violin,Relevant
Starting with a precut blank the feet of the bridge are cut to fit the arching of the top at the proper positionbetween the nicks of the soundholes,Relevant
The top of the bridge is cut to an arch which matches the curvature of the fmgerboard and provides the proper height of the strings,Relevant
The front side facing the neck is planed down to a thickness of about 4 5 mm at the bottom and tapering from the middle to 1 5 mm at the top,Relevant
Grooves for the strings are cut and filed using a gauge to establish their proper position and spacing,Relevant
The soundpost transmits the vibrations of the strings to the back of the violin,Relevant
It is cut from a round piece of straight grained spruce about 6 mm in diameter,Relevant
Its length and ends must be cut so that it fits precisely in the proper location inside the violin about 3 mm behind the treble foot of the bridge,Relevant
A gauge may be used to measure the approximate length of the sound post but the final fit is a trial and error process,Irrelevant
The soundpost is inserted and its position adjusted through the soundholes using a special tool,Relevant
The strings are now fitted into the tailpiece extended over the bridge and wound on the pegs,Relevant
Once all four strings are installed they may be tuned up to pitch and the violin played for the first time,Relevant
What follows will be a period of adjustment as the violin becomes accustomed to the tension of the strings and their vibration,Relevant
Numerous adjustments to the position of the soundpost the bridge types of strings and perhaps other factors are usually necessary to optimize the tonal characteristics and playability,Relevant
Roughing the stick refers to the process of carving and planing the stick to its approximate finished dimensions,Irrelevant
The squared off blank of Pemnambuco wood is either held across the corner of a bench or along the length of a special board and planed by hand with specially designed planes fashioning the stick into its characteristic octagon shape,Irrelevant
Using a direct heat device such as a spirit lamp or gas burner the stick is heated slowly until it becomes flexible enough to bend,Relevant
When ready the stick is bent into an approximate or rough curve,Relevant
When cooled the stick is set aside and the work on the frog begins,Relevant
The frog begins with the fashioning of the metal fittings,Relevant
Several parts require soldering as well as bending and shaping,Relevant
The ferrule much like a half round ring is a semicircular length of sheet silver soldered to a flat one,Irrelevant
The button for the adjuster needs one or two silver rings,Irrelevant
The other metal parts include a silver liner which is shaped to three facets of an octagon on a steel die to conform to the three facets on which it will contact the stick,Irrelevant
If the frog is designed with a back plate the plate is shaped and bent to the 90 degree angle of the back of the frog where it is to be inlaid,Irrelevant
The ebony wedge is trimmed to length and planed true to its center on all sides with a small razor sharp block plane,Relevant
The various metal fittings are fit onto the frog in their respective places,Relevant
Although modern commercial manufacture uses milling machinery to accomplish this part the best modern builders have no problem doing this work by hand,Irrelevant
The fitting of the metal to the frog begins with drilling a 3 mm hole called the throat just under the area where the ferrule is located,Relevant
The ferrule is fit onto the wider part of the throat with a knife and small chisels until it fits back flush and level,Irrelevant
The sides are shaped concave with a gouge,Relevant
The slot for the pearl slide with its 20 degree under cut sides is next to be shaved out with the chisels,Relevant
The cavity for the hair called the hair mortise is drilled and carved into the frog with a bow drill and chisel,Relevant
The liner is then fit to the narrow edge of the frog s length using the chisels,Relevant
The liner conformns to the top three facets of the stick s octagonal shape and is the bearing surface of the frog against the stick,Irrelevant
A tapered silver back plate extending from the back of the pearl slide slot to the center facet of the liner is inlaid to the flat end of the frog,Relevant
The frog is then shaped using a knife files and small scrapers made of thin steel sheet,Relevant
The decorations called the eyes are inlaid into the sides of the frog at this point,Relevant
Then the ebony dowel for the adjuster button is fashioned separately on a lathe,Relevant
After the frog is done the next job is to fit it to the roughed out stick,Relevant
This is done by chalking the liner of the frog and rubbing it against the facets of the stick at the point where the frog makes contact,Relevant
Through a process of marking the stick in this way and carefully planing scraping and filing the marks away the frog is brought into the proper contact with the three bottom facets,Relevant
Then holes are drilled in the stick for the screw and eye assembly which attaches the frog to the brass nut at the end of the stick,Relevant
The first step here is to fit an ivory plate to the head or tip of the bow,Relevant
A plate of ivory is prepared with a raised section for the right angle of the beak with a thin lamination of ebony veneer all along its inside surface,Relevant
The ivory is glued to the bottom face of the head,Relevant
The shaping of the head is done with a knife and files,Relevant
This work usually follows an established model and is accomplished with the means of a pattern or template which is alternately traced and compared with the carving as it progresses,Irrelevant
The elegant head models of the classic bows are often very beautiful and have inspired connoisseurs the world over to collect them,Irrelevant
All the great bowmakers imprinted their work with their own personal style and experts are easily able to recognize most of the important styles each head being akin to the signature of the maker,Irrelevant
Once the head is finished the mortise for the hair is cut into it and the finishing of the stick can continue,Relevant
The stick must be now brought into final dimension a process called graduation,Relevant
The stick tapers from 3 44321 0 mm just behind the head to 6 44413 5 mm at the button end,Relevant
Using a gauge or caliper the craftsman skillfully planes this transition of thickness into the stick,Relevant
The whole process must be done while preserving the integrity of a perfect octagon,Relevant
The octagon s transition into the head is most difficult and ends with the top three facets converging upwards the two side facets becoming the side of the head and the bottom three becoming the back of the head and the chamfers a thin finish cut at a 45 degree angle to the sides ,Relevant
All of this work is accomplished with either the plane in the case of the facets or the knife and file for the detailing of the head,Irrelevant
The stick is simply held by hand across a flat board or the corner of the workbench while planing the facets,Irrelevant
The head is simply held in the hand while finishing,Irrelevant
If the stick is to be finished round as many are the edges of the octagon are planed away after graduation and the stick is rounded off in this manner to an area about 1 4423 3 4 inches 4 6 cm in front of the frog,Irrelevant
The area where one holds the bow is almost always octagonal,Irrelevant
The bow usually has no real varnish as such because Pernambuco is inherently dark and oily,Irrelevant
But the stick may be subjected to a number of chemical treatments to achieve its characteristic chocolate brown color,Irrelevant
Bathing the stick with nitric acid and then following with a neutralizing exposure to ammonia fumes is the most common color treatment,Relevant
The bow is given additional sheen and protection by a technique known as French polishing,Irrelevant
This involves the application of a dilute solution of shellac sometimes mixed with other gums or resins with a lightly oiled rag held wrapped around the fingers The roughing and finishing of bow sticks do not vary in technique from hand making to commercial manufacture Most violin bows are made completely by hand Only the speed of production quality of materials and diligence in finishing distinguish the difference between the mediocre and the sublime 6 The lapping or winding acts as a grip for the stick and is often called the grip,Relevant
It usually covers a 3 inch 7 6 cm length starting from just in front of the frog and going toward the tip,Irrelevant
It consists of some material usually silver wire wound in a compact spiral fashion around the stick,Irrelevant
Part of the winding nearest the frog is covered with leather to protect the spot where the player s thumb rests,Relevant
The hairing of the bow is quite routine as the hair wears from playing and must be frequently replaced,Relevant
The horsehair is purchased already selected drawn and bundled in uniform lengths,Relevant
A small amount is separated from this and a small rosined knot is fashioned at one end using very strong thin thread,Relevant
The knot is made stronger by inserting the end of the hair into the heat of a flame and expanding the hair behind it,Relevant
A small wooden plug is carved to fit the mortise in the head and the hair is turned under and fastened into the head with this plug which holds the hair spread across the top edge in a neat uniform flat strip,Relevant
With the frog all the way forward the hair is measured to length cut off and after much combing and arranging tied in a similar way at the end near the frog,Relevant
Another wooden plug is fashioned for the mortise of the frog,Relevant
The ferrule is slid over the hair and after much more combing the hair is turned over and fastened again with a wooden plug this time into the frog,Relevant
The hair is combed again before pushing in the pearl slide and again after sliding on the ferrule,Relevant
A wooden wedge is carved to fit the width of the ferrule so as to hold the hair spread in a ribbon like fashion,Relevant
After some more combing the wedge is pushed into the ferrule against the hair and trimmed off with a knife,Relevant
With the application of some rosin on the hair for grip the new bow is ready to play,Relevant
Truckloads of grain are shipped directly from farms to the whiskey manufacturer to be stored in silos until needed,Irrelevant
The grain is inspected and cleaned to remove all dust and other foreign particles,Relevant
All grains except barley are first ground into meal in a gristmill,Relevant
The meal is then mixed with water and cooked to break down the cellulose walls that contain starch granules,Relevant
This can be done in a closed pressure cooker at temperatures of up to 311 F 155 C or more slowly in an open cooker at 212 F 100 C ,Relevant
Instead of being cooked barley is malted,Relevant
The first step in malting barley consists of soaking it in water until it is thoroughly saturated,Relevant
It is then spread out and sprinkled with water for about three weeks at which time it begins to sprout,Relevant
During this germination the enzyme amylase is produced which converts the starch in the barley into sugars,Relevant
The sprouting is halted by drying the barley and heating it with hot air from a kiln,Relevant
For Scotch whiskey the fuel used in the kiln includes peat a soft carbon rich substance formed when plant matter decomposes in water,Irrelevant
The peat gives Scotch whiskey a characteristic smoky taste,Irrelevant
The malted barley is then ground like other grains,Relevant
Mashing consists of mixing cooked grain with malted barley and warm water,Irrelevant
The amylase in the malted barley converts the starch in the other grains into sugars,Relevant
After several hours the mixture is converted into a turbid sugar rich liquid known as mash,Relevant
In making Scotch malt whiskey the mixture consists only of malted barley and water ,Irrelevant
After mashing the mixture is filtered to produce a sugar rich liquid known as wort,Relevant
The mash or wort is transferred to a fermentation vessel usually closed in Scotland and open in the United States,Relevant
These vessels may be made of wood or stainless steel,Relevant
Yeast is added to begin fermentation in which the single celled yeast organisms convert the sugars in the mash or wort to alcohol,Relevant
The yeast may be added in the form of new never used yeast cells the sweet mash process or in the form of a portion of a previous batch of fermentation the sour mash process ,Irrelevant
The sour mash method is more often used because it is effective at room temperature and its low pH high acidity promotes yeast growth and inhibits the growth of bacteria,Irrelevant
The sweet mash method is more difficult to control and it must be used at temperatures above 80 F 27 C to speed up the fermentation and to avoid bacterial contamination,Irrelevant
After three or four days the end product of fermentation is a liquid containing about 10% alcohol known as distiller s beer in the United States or wash in Scotland,Irrelevant
Scottish whiskeymakers often distill their wash in traditional copper pot stills,Irrelevant
The wash is heated so that most of the alcohol which boils at 172 F [78 C] is transformed into vapor but most of the water which boils at 212 F [100 C] is not,Relevant
This vapor is transferred back into liquid alcohol in a water cooled condenser and collected,Relevant
Most modern distilleries use a continuous still,Irrelevant
This consists of a tall cylindrical column filled with a series of perforated plates,Irrelevant
Steam enters the still from the bottom and distiller s beer enters from the top,Irrelevant
The beer is distilled as it slowly drips through the plates and the alcohol is condensed back into a liquid,Relevant
With either method the product of the initial distillationknown as low wineis distilled a second time to produce a product known as high wine or new whiskey which contains about 70% alcohol,Irrelevant
The temperature of distillation and other factors determine the proportions of water alcohol and other substances called congeners in the final product,Irrelevant
If it contains more than 95% alcohol it will have no flavor because it has no congeners,Irrelevant
This product is known as grain neutral spirit and is often used to add alcohol without adding taste during blending,Irrelevant
If the final product has too many congeners of the wrong kind it will taste bad,Irrelevant
Distillers remove bad tasting congeners usually aldehydes acids esters and higher alcohols in various ways,Irrelevant
Some congeners boil at a lower temperature than alcohol and can be boiled off,Irrelevant
Some are lighter than alcohol and will float on top where they can be poured off,Irrelevant
Tennessee whiskey is unique in that the high wine is filtered through charcoal before it is aged,Irrelevant
The charcoal is produced by burnning wood from sugar maples,Irrelevant
This filtration removes unwanted congeners and results in a particularly smooth whiskey,Irrelevant
Premium Tennessee whiskey may be filtered through charcoal again after it is aged to produce an even smoother product,Irrelevant
Water is added to the high wine to reduce its alcohol content to about 50% or 60% for American whiskeys and about 65% or higher for Scotch whiskeys,Irrelevant
Scotch whiskeys are aged in cool wet conditions so they absorb water and become less alcoholic,Irrelevant
American whiskeys are aged in warmer drier conditions so they lose water and become more alcoholic,Irrelevant
Whiskey is aged in wooden barrels usually made from charred white oak,Irrelevant
White oak is used because it is one of the few woods that can hold a liquid without leaking but which also allows the water in the whiskey to move back and forth within the pores of the wood which helps to add flavor,Irrelevant
In the United States these barrels are usually new and are only used once,Irrelevant
In most other countries it is common to reuse old barrels,Irrelevant
New barrels add more flavor than used barrels resulting in differences in the taste of American and foreign whiskeys,Irrelevant
The aging process is a complex one still not fully understood but at least three factors are involved,Irrelevant
First the original mixture of water alcohol and congeners react with each other over time,Irrelevant
Second these ingredients react with oxygen in the outside air in oxidation reactions,Irrelevant
Third the water absorbs substances from the wood as it moves within it,Irrelevant
Charring the wood makes these substances more soluble in water ,Irrelevant
All these factors change the flavor of the whiskey,Irrelevant
Whiskey generally takes at least three or four years to mature and many whiskeys are aged for ten or fifteen years,Irrelevant
Straight whiskeys and single malt Scotch whiskeys are not blended that is they are produced from single batches and are ready to be bottled straight from the barrel,Irrelevant
All other whiskeys are blended,Irrelevant
Different batches of whiskey are mixed together to produce a better flavor,Relevant
Often neutral grain spirit is added to lighten the flavor caramel is added to standardize the color and a small amount of sherry or port wine is added to help the flavors blend,Irrelevant
Blended Scotch whiskey usually consists of several batches of strongly flavored malt whiskeys mixed with less strongly flavored grain whiskeys,Irrelevant
A few blends contain only malt whiskeys,Irrelevant
Blending is often considered the most difficult and critical process in producing premium Scotch whiskeys,Irrelevant
A premium blended Scotch whiskey may contain more than 60 individual malt whiskeys which must be blended in the proper proportions,Irrelevant
Glass is always used to store mature whiskey because it does not react with it to change the flavor,Irrelevant
Modern distilleries use automated machinery to produce as many as 400 bottles of whiskey per minute,Irrelevant
The glass bottles move down a conveyor belt as they are cleaned filled capped sealed labeled and placed in cardboard boxes,Relevant
The whiskey is ready to be shipped to liquor stores bars and restaurants,Relevant
The sour mash method is more often used because it is effective at room temperature and its low pH high acidity promotes yeast growth and inhibits the growth of bacteria,Irrelevant
All these factors change the flavor of the whiskey,Irrelevant
Straight whiskeys and single malt Scotch whiskeys are not blended that is they are produced from single batches and are ready to be bottled straight from the barrel,Irrelevant
Zinc ores are dug from underground mines using conventional blasting drilling and hauling techniques,Irrelevant
The ores occur as zinc sulfide also called sphalerite zinc carbonate smithsonite zinc silicate calimine and in compounds of manganese and iron franklinite ,Irrelevant
Zinc ore is sometimes mined in conjunction with silver or lead ores,Irrelevant
In addition to the ore itself oil and sulfuric acid are required for the breakdown of the ores and electricity coke or natural gas are needed to provide the heat energy for smelting,Irrelevant
Zinc can be produced by a process called froth flotation which is also used for reduction of copper and lead ores,Irrelevant
This process involves grinding the zinc ore to a fine powder mixing it with water pine oil and flotation chemicals and then agitating the mixture to float the zinc to the surface,Irrelevant
A variety of chemicals are used to coat the important zinc particles and prevent them from becoming wetted by the water,Relevant
Then air is injected and the coated minerals attach themselves to the bubbles,Relevant
The operation is performed inside a vat and agitated with an impeller,Relevant
The rotating impeller draws the air down the standpipe that surrounds the impeller shaft and dissipates it throughout the mixture or pulp,Relevant
The zinc rises to the top and the residue stays in the bottom of the pulp since it cannot adhere to the bubbles,Irrelevant
Automatic scrapers remove the mineral laden froth containing the zinc,Relevant
The froth is filtered to remove the water and liquid oils,Relevant
The paste like remainder is mixed with lime and sent to a furnace,Relevant
The furnace roasts the mixture at 2500 F 1371 C which fuses the minerals into solid chunks called sinter,Relevant
At this point the material has been completely converted to zinc oxide,Relevant
The next reduction process uses a blast furnace to melt the prepared ore into its elemental components,Relevant
The blast furnace is fueled by electricity coke or natural gas which generate temperatures of up to 2200 F 1204 C ,Relevant
This however also generates carbon dioxide which recombines with the zinc as it cools to re form zinc oxide,Relevant
To reduce this reformation the zinc is sprayed with molten lead while it is still hot,Relevant
The lead at 1022 F 550 C dissolves the zinc and carries it to another chamber where it is cooled to 824 F 440 C ,Relevant
At this temperature the lighter zinc separates out of the lead and is drained off the top,Relevant
The lead is reheated and returned to the blast furnace,Relevant
Further metal improvement can be made by keeping the zinc molten and undisturbed for several hours,Irrelevant
In this state iron and other contaminants settle to the bottom allowing the almost pure zinc to be carefully drawn off the top and cast into ingots,Relevant
Most zinc is alloyed with other metals before use to improve its properties,Irrelevant
Alloying involves remelting and mixing the zinc with other metals in precise proportions,Relevant
For example approximately 4% aluminum is added to improve casting quality and die life in the die casting process,Irrelevant
Other added alloys are small amounts of titanium copper and magnesium,Relevant
After alloying the molten metal is poured into sow molds and ingot molds,Relevant
Sows can weigh several thousand pounds while ingots weigh about 45 pounds 20 kg ,Irrelevant
The manufacture of an accordion is not a completely automated process,Irrelevant
In a sense all accordions could be called handmade since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required,Irrelevant
The general process involves making the individual parts assembling the subsections assembling the entire instrument and final decorating and packaging,Irrelevant
Depending on the manufacturer the parts of an accordion can be supplied by outside manufacturers or made in house,Irrelevant
The wooden parts are typically cut into the appropriate shapes by jigs and presses,Relevant
This is an automated process in which the wood passes by these machines and is then cut,Relevant
This system significantly simplifies the repeated making of identical components and ensures they are made with a high degree of precision,Irrelevant
The plastic components of the accordion such as the buttons and keys are usually produced by injection molding,Relevant
In this approach plastic is supplied as granules or powder and is fed into a large hopper,Relevant
It is then heated converting it into a liquid that can then be forcibly injected into a mold,Relevant
Various processes are used to construct the many metal parts of an accordion,Irrelevant
These typically involve melting the metal to a liquid form then placing it in a preformed mold,Relevant
When the metal is cooled and hardened the mold is opened and the part is complete,Relevant
In the case of the reeds the metal is specially treated by a process called tempering,Relevant
This reduces the hardness and brittleness of the metal making it more ductile and tough,Irrelevant
After the individual parts are made partial assembly begins,Irrelevant
The reeds are riveted or screwed to an aluminum alloy reed plate,Relevant
This plate has two slots and the reeds are attached over each on opposite sides,Relevant
On the open end of each slot a leather or plastic valve is secured,Relevant
The reed plates are then arranged in a specific order and attached to a wooden reed block,Relevant
Depending on the model three or four of these blocks are put in the treble and bass side casings,Relevant
The treble keyboard is attached to the reed block and the bass side buttons and keyboards are also attached,Relevant
The bellows is typically supplied by outside manufacturers,Relevant
It is made by folding and pleating strong cardboard and reinforcing it with leather and steel strips,Relevant
The treble and bass casings are attached to it and sealed with wax to prevent air leakage,Relevant
After the main parts have been assembled various decorative finishing touches are put on the accordion,Relevant
For example the instrument is painted the treble grill is attached and the manufacturer s name is added,Irrelevant
The accordion is then put in its case packaged and shipped to distributors for sale,Relevant
Sculpted acrylic nails are not manufactured on an assembly line by a machine,Irrelevant
Instead as the name implies they are sculpted by a nail technician,Relevant
Each handcrafted nail is formed one at a time using a process which consists of the following steps cleansing priming mixing sculpting and finishing,Irrelevant
Before the new nail can be sculpted the natural nail must be properly prepared,Relevant
A nail bed cleanser is used to thoroughly clean the surface of the nail,Relevant
These cleansers are typically solvents such as isopropyl alcohol which dissolve oils and grease from the surface of the nail,Irrelevant
They will also remove bacteria from the area to help reduce the chance of infection,Irrelevant
Care must be used when applying these solvents because they may dry out the skin surrounding the cuticle,Irrelevant
This occurs because the solvents also remove the skin s own natural moisturizing oils,Irrelevant
After the nail bed has been cleansed a primer is applied to the nail bed to make sure the acrylic will adhere properly,Relevant
Primers are available in two types non etching and etching,Irrelevant
The non etching type works like double sided tape one side of the primer is very good at sticking to the natural nail and the other end is equally attracted to the acrylic polymers used in the artificial nail,Irrelevant
The etching type of primers are acids such as methacrylic acid which actually dissolve a thin layer of the nail itself,Irrelevant
This etching process allows the acrylic to adhere to the nail better,Relevant
The etching primers are more commonly used than non etching,Irrelevant
There is some debate regarding the proper use of etching primers some chemists argue that the primer should dry thoroughly before applying the acrylic,Irrelevant
Others believe that the acrylic should be applied while the primer is still wet to pull the acrylic deeper into the nail and anchor it more firmly,Irrelevant
The resin is made when the acrylic liquid is mixed with the acrylic powder,Relevant
The nail technician must work quickly with the resin once the liquid and powder are mixed,Relevant
If not the resin will harden before it can shaped into a nail and will not be useable,Irrelevant
Before the resin is applied a nail shaped form is placed over each fingertip in order to hold the resin in place and ensure it takes the correct size and shape,Relevant
These forms may be made of metalized foil or plastic,Irrelevant
One common type consists of a thin metallic foil with an adhesive backing,Irrelevant
The form is peeled off a roll like a label and carefully affixed to the fingers,Relevant
The technician then applies the resin to the client s fingertips,Relevant
The resin is sculpted to look as natural as possible before the resin hardens,Relevant
The form is then removed,Relevant
After the acrylic dries the new nail is filed and manicured to shape,Relevant
Finally coatings and polishes are used to complete the manicure,Relevant
As the natural nail grows further application of the liquid plastic is needed for the acrylic nail to maintain a regular contour,Relevant
In some cases an acetate tip is also applied to the end of the nail to provide a stronger base for the layers of acrylic resin,Relevant
Most air conditioners start out as raw material in the form of structural steel shapes and sheet steel,Irrelevant
As the sheet metal is processed into fabrication cells or work cells it is cut formed punched drilled sheared and or bent into a useful shape or form,Irrelevant
The encasements or wrappers the metal that envelopes most outdoor residential units is made of galvanized sheet metal that uses a zinc coating to provide protection against corrosion,Irrelevant
Galvanized sheet metal is also used to form the bottom pan face plates and various support brackets throughout an air conditioner,Irrelevant
This sheet metal is sheared on a shear press in a fabrication cell soon after arriving from storage or inventory,Relevant
Structural steel shapes are cut and mitered on a band saw to form useful brackets and supports,Relevant
From the shear press the sheet metal is loaded on a CNC Computer Numerical Control punch press,Relevant
The punch press has the option of receiving its computer program from a drafting CAD CAM Computer Aided Drafting Computer Aided Manufacturing program or from an independently written CNC program,Irrelevant
The CAD CAM program will transform a drafted or modeled part on the computer into a file that can be read by the punch press telling it where to punch holes in the sheet metal,Relevant
Dies and other punching instruments are stored in the machine and mechanically brought to the punching arm where it can be used to drive through the sheet,Relevant
The NC Numerically Controlled press brakes bend the sheet into its final form using a computer file to program itself,Relevant
Different bending dies are used for different shapes and configurations and may be changed for each component,Irrelevant
Some brackets fins and sheet components are outsourced to other facilities or companies to produce large quantities,Irrelevant
They are brought to the assembly plant only when needed for assembly,Irrelevant
Many of the brackets are produced on a hydraulic or mechanical press where brackets of different shapes and configurations can be produced from a coiled sheet and unrolled continuously into the machine,Irrelevant
High volumes of parts can be produced because the press can often produce a complex shape with one hit,Irrelevant
All parts must be completely clean and free of dirt oil grease and lubricants before they are powder coated,Irrelevant
Various cleaning methods are used to accomplish this necessary task,Irrelevant
Large solution tanks filled with a cleaning solvent agitate and knock off the oil when parts are submersed,Relevant
Spray wash systems use pressurized cleaning solutions to knock off dirt and grease,Relevant
Vapor degreasing suspending the parts above a harsh cleansing vapor uses an acid solution and will leave the parts free of petroleum products,Relevant
Most outsourced parts that arrive from a vendor have already been degreased and cleaned,Irrelevant
For additional corrosion protection many parts will be primed in a phosphate primer bath before entering a drying oven to prepare them for the application of the powder coating,Irrelevant
Before brackets pans and wrappers are assembled together they are fed through a powder coating operation,Relevant
The powder coating system sprays a paint like dry powder onto the parts as they are fed through a booth on an overhead conveyor,Relevant
This can be done by robotic sprayers that are programmed where to spray as each part feeds through the booth on the conveyor,Irrelevant
The parts are statically charged to attract the powder to adhere to deep crevices and bends within each part,Relevant
The powder coated parts are then fed through an oven usually with the same conveyor system where the powder is permanently baked onto the metal,Relevant
The process takes less than 10 minutes,Irrelevant
The condenser and evaporator both act as a heat exchanger in air conditioning systems and are made of copper or aluminum tubing bent around in coil form to maximize the distance through which the working fluid travels,Relevant
The opposing fluid or cooling fluid passes around the tubes as the working fluid draws away its heat in the evaporator,Relevant
This is accomplished by taking many small diameter copper tubes bent in the same shape and anchoring them with guide rods and aluminum plates,Irrelevant
The working fluid or refrigerant flows through the copper tubes and the opposing fluid flows around them in between the aluminum plates,Irrelevant
The tubes will often end up with hairpin bends performed by NC benders using the same principle as the NC press brake,Relevant
Each bend is identical to the next,Irrelevant
The benders use previously straightened tubing to bend around a fixed die with a mandrel fed through the inner diameter to keep it from collapsing during the bend,Relevant
The mandrel is raked back through the inside of the tube when the bend has been accomplished,Relevant
Tubing supplied to the manufacturer in a coil form goes through an uncoiler and straightener before being fed through the bender,Relevant
Some tubing will be cut into desired lengths on an abrasive saw that will cut several small tubes in one stroke,Relevant
The aluminum plates are punched out on a punch press and formed on a mechanical press to place divots or waves in the plate,Relevant
These waves maximize the thermodynamic heat transfer between the working fluid and the opposing medium,Irrelevant
When the copper tubes are finished in the bending cell they are transported by automatic guided vehicle AGV to the assembly cell where they are stacked on the guide rods and fed through the plates or fins,Relevant
A major part of the assembly is the joining of the copper tubing with the aluminum plates,Irrelevant
This assembly becomes the evaporator and is accomplished by taking the stacked copper tubing in their hairpin configuration and mechanically fusing them to the aluminum plates,Relevant
The fusing occurs by taking a bullet or mandrel and feeding it through the copper tubing to expand it and push it against the inner part of the hole of the plate,Irrelevant
This provides a thrifty yet useful bond between the tubing and plate allowing for heat transfer,Irrelevant
The condenser is manufactured in a similar manner except that the opposing medium is usually air which cools off the copper or aluminum condenser coils without the plates,Irrelevant
They are held by brackets which support the coiled tubing and are connected to the evaporator with fittings or couplings,Relevant
The condenser is usually just one tube that may be bent around in a number of hairpin bends,Irrelevant
The expansion valve a complete component is purchased from a vendor and installed in the piping after the condenser,Relevant
It allows the pressure of the working fluid to decrease and re enter the pump,Irrelevant
The pump is also purchased complete I h from an outside supplier,Irrelevant
Designed to increase system pressure and circulate the working fluid the pump is connected with fittings to the system and anchored in place by support brackets and a base,Irrelevant
It is bolted together with the other structural members of the air conditioner and covered by the wrapper or sheet metal encasement,Relevant
The encasement is either riveted or bolted together to provide adequate protection for the inner components,Relevant
The envelope is made of patterns of fabric panels,Irrelevant
Two or three plies of cloth are impregnated with an elastomer,Relevant
One of these plies is placed in a bias direction with respect to others,Relevant
The pieces of the envelope can be put together in a number of ways,Irrelevant
They can be cemented and sewn together or heat welded heat sealed ,Irrelevant
The outside of the envelope is coated with aluminized paint for protection against sunlight,Relevant
The envelope will have the required shape when filled with gas,Irrelevant
The catenery curtains are attached on to the main envelope proper in a similar manner,Relevant
The bladder is formed from strips that are welded together,Relevant
The tail construction consists mostly of lightweight metal structural beams covered with doped fabric,Irrelevant
They are held to the envelope by cables which distribute the load into fabric patches cemented or heat welded to the envelope proper,Relevant
They are not directly attached to the envelope in the manufacturing process but put on when the blimp is inflated,Relevant
The frame of the gondola is made of material similar to the tail construction covered with doped fabric,Irrelevant
The erection of the blimp takes only a short amount of time,Irrelevant
The following is only one method of inflation ,Irrelevant
There are variations on this method,Irrelevant
The envelope is spread out on the floor of the airship hangar with a net placed over it,Relevant
This net is held down by sandbags,Relevant
Gas is fed into the enveloped from tank cars each containing 200 000 cu ft 5 700 cu m of 99 9% pure helium compressed to 2100 psi 14 5 megapascals ,Relevant
The net is allowed to slowly rise with the envelope underneath it,Relevant
Fins nose cone battens air valves and helium valves are attached while the envelope is still near the ground,Relevant
After these parts are attached the envelope is allowed to rise high enough to permit rolling the gondola underneath it,Relevant
After the gondola is attached the net is removed and the airship is rigged for flight,Relevant
When transported the uninflated fabric envelopes can be folded shipped and stored in a space that takes up less than 1% of its inflated volume,Relevant
This feature makes the non rigid airship more practical than a rigid one,Irrelevant
Creating an animated short or full length feature is a long tedious process,Irrelevant
Extremely labor intensive the average short cartoon has approximately 45 000 separate frames,Irrelevant
To make a character say Hello Simon can require 12 drawings to depict each movement of the character s lips,Irrelevant
Sometimes the animator is also the writer,Irrelevant
The animator makes a storyboard a series of one panel sketches pinned on a board,Relevant
Dialogue and or action summaries are written under each sketch,Relevant
The sketches may be rearranged several times as a result of discussions between the writer the animator and the director,Relevant
Actors record the voices of each character,Relevant
Background music and sound effects such as doors slamming footsteps and weather sounds are recorded,Relevant
These recordings are generally preserved on magnetic tape,Relevant
The music is timed for beats and accents this information is recorded on a bar sheet so that the animation can be fitted around the music,Relevant
Because Walt Disney was one of the first animators to fit the action to the music this process is called Mickey Mousing,Irrelevant
Many professional studios now use an optical sound track on which voices music and sound effects are represented by varying lines An electronic sound reader and synchronizer gives an accurate count of the number of frames required for each sound 3 A technician known as a track reader measures each vowel and consonant in the dialogue Words are recorded on exposure sheets also called x sheets or dope sheets each of which represents a single film frame This allows the animators to synchronize each movement of the character s lips with the dialogue Footage the time needed between lines of dialogue for the action to take place is also charted on the exposure sheet Slugs or sections of film without sound are inserted where the action occurs 4 A model is created for each character in order to keep their appearances uniform throughout the film The models can be detailed descriptions or sketches of the characters in various positions with various facial expressions 5 A layout artist creates linear drawings that animators use as a guide for action and that the background artists use to paint the backgrounds 6 Using the model sheets the head animator sketches the primary or extreme action,Irrelevant
For example if the character is running the head animator will draw the foot leaving the floor the foot in the air and the foot returning to the floor,Irrelevant
Or if the story calls for the character to blink the head animator will sketch the eyes going through the motions,Irrelevant
Animation assistants then fill in the details,Relevant
The drawing is done on a transparent drawing board that is lighted from below,Relevant
After one drawing is completed a second sheet of paper is laid on top of the first and the second drawing is varied slightly to signify movement,Relevant
Drawings are cleaned up and checked for accuracy 7 Artists check the characters against the model sheets,Relevant
Drawings are enhanced but not altered,Relevant
Scenes are checked to ensure that all action called for on the exposure sheet is included,Relevant
All figures are checked for proper line up with the background,Relevant
A video test is conducted 8 A computerized videotape is made of the sketches to check for smoothness of motion and proper facial expressions,Relevant
Adjustments are made until the desired effect is achieved,Relevant
Artists create backgrounds 9 Artists create color background paintings including landscapes scenery buildings and interiors from the pencil layouts,Relevant
The color is filled in by computer,Relevant
As the computer scans the layout artists click on colors from a template,Relevant
Sketches are inked in and painted 10 If the animation drawings have been executed on paper they are now transferred to cels using xerography a process similar to photocopying,Relevant
In a few studios the inking is still done by hand tracing the pencil sketches onto the cels,Irrelevant
Colors are applied to the reverse side of the cel usually by computer in the same manner that background colors are applied,Relevant
All inked and painted materials are checked several times for accuracy,Relevant
The action is filmed 11 The cels and backgrounds are photographed according to the instructions on the exposure sheets,Relevant
One scene of action can take several hours to photograph,Irrelevant
The cels are laid on top of the backgrounds and photographed with a multiplane camera that is suspended high above,Relevant
When more than one character appears in a frame the number of cels stacked on top of the background increases,Irrelevant
Each level is lit and staggered creating the illusion of three dimensional action,Irrelevant
The film is sent to the photo lab where a print and a negative are made,Relevant
The sound is dubbed 12 Dialogue music and sound effects are re recorded from 10 or more separate tracks onto one balanced track,Relevant
Another set of two tracks one with dialogue and the other with music and sound effects is often made to facilitate translation when the film is sent to foreign markets,Relevant
The dubbing track and print are combined 13 The final dubbing track is combined with the print to make a married print,Relevant
If the animated film is for television viewing the negative and the tracks are often sent to a video post production house to be put on videotape,Relevant
The following description applies generically to reusable hard tags details may vary among manufacturers,Irrelevant
Disposable security tags are manufactured in a similar manner except that the resonator is sealed inside a flexible plastic envelope which may be backed with adhesive,Irrelevant
The plastic casing for the tag is vacuum formed or injection molded,Relevant
In the former process plastic that has been softened by heat is drawn into a mold by creation of a vacuum,Relevant
In the latter semi molten plastic is squirted under pressure into a cooled mold where it hardens quickly,Relevant
There are several ways a resonator can be made,Irrelevant
One technique involves laminating copper or aluminum coils onto a web of nonconductive material,Relevant
This is done by passing the adhesive coated base web between rollers that apply a spiral shaped mask of non sticky material after which the web passes through a dryer to set the mask,Relevant
A thin flat strip of metal is then laminated to the uncoated sticky portion of the base web,Relevant
The laminated strip subsequently passes between a backup roller and a cutting roller which cuts through the metal but not the base web disconnecting the individual metal coils from one another,Relevant
This masking and laminating process is repeated adding a layer of web with metal spirals atop the first layer so that the two layers of spirals are face to face separated by a layer of dielectric nonconductive material,Relevant
Finally the laminated strip is cut into individual resonators that can be inserted into security tags,Relevant
Another type of resonator is made by winding insulated encased in plastic copper wire into a flat spiral of about a dozen loops with the ends of the wire connected through a diode,Irrelevant
One company makes a button shaped tag that can operate with a very small diameter coil because the wire is spiraled into a cone shape,Relevant
After the resonator is inserted into the security tag s plastic casing the locking mechanism is installed,Relevant
This usually consists of a clutch that will accept and lock a metal pin that can be inserted through a product at the retail store,Irrelevant
There are numerous designs of clutches but one example is a metal plate with a small hole in the middle,Irrelevant
The hole is too small for the pin s shaft to pass through unless the metal plate is flexed to enlarge the hole,Relevant
Once the pin is inserted the plate flattens and the minimized hole fits around a grooved section in the shaft of the pin,Relevant
To release this grip the sales clerk inserts the tag into a magnetic device that flexes the clutch plate allowing the pin to slide free,Relevant
Another example of a clutch type is a ring of tiny balls that encircle the pin with a spring mechanism pressing the balls into a groove in the pin s shaft a magnetic deactivator retracts the balls from the groove releasing the pin,Irrelevant
Still other tag designs use a mechanical deactivator that inserts a probe into the tag to physically disengage a locking device,Relevant
With the resonator and clutch assemblies in place the upper and lower portions of the plastic tag casing are attached together,Relevant
They are sealed by heat or welded by ultrasound,Relevant
Finally the completed tags are counted and boxed for shipment,Relevant
The time to make an ocular prosthesis from start to finish varies with each ocularist and the individual patient,Irrelevant
A typical time is about 3 5 hours,Irrelevant
Ocularists continue to look at ways to reduce this time,Irrelevant
There are two types of prostheses,Irrelevant
The very thin shell type is fitted over a blind disfigured eye or over an eye which has been just partially removed,Irrelevant
The full modified impression type is made for those who have had eyeballs completely removed,Irrelevant
The process described here is for the latter type,Irrelevant
The ocularist inspects the condition of the socket,Relevant
The horizontal and vertical dimensions and the periphery of the socket are measured,Relevant
The ocularist paints the iris,Relevant
An iris button made from a plastic rod using a lathe is selected to match the patient s own iris diameter,Relevant
Typically iris diameters range from 0 4 0 52 in 10 13 mm ,Irrelevant
The iris is painted on the back flat side of the button and checked against the patient s iris by simply reversing the buttons so that the color can be seen through the dome of plastic,Relevant
When the color is finished the ocularist removes the conformer which prevents contraction of the eye socket,Relevant
Next the ocularist hand carves a wax molding shell,Relevant
This shell has an aluminum iris button imbedded in it that duplicates the painted iris button,Relevant
The wax shell is fitted into the patient s socket so that it matches the irregular periphery of the socket,Relevant
The shell may have to be reinserted several times until the aluminum iris button is aligned with the patient s remaining eye,Irrelevant
Once properly fitted two relief holes are made in the wax shell,Relevant
The impression is made using alginate a white powder made from seaweed that is mixed with water to form a cream which is also used by dentists to make impressions of gums,Irrelevant
After mixing the cream is placed on the back side of the molding shell and the shell is inserted into the socket,Relevant
The alginate gels in about two minutes and precisely duplicates the individual eye socket,Relevant
The wax shell is removed with the alginate For a conventional implant the surgeon removes the eyeball by severing the muscles which are connected to the sclera white of eyeball ,Relevant
The surgeon then cuts the optic nerve and removes the eye from the socket,Relevant
An implant is then placed into the socket to restore lost volume and to give the artificial eye some movement and the wound is closed,Relevant
impression of the eye socket attached to the back side of the wax shell,Irrelevant
The iris color is then rechecked and any necessary changes are made,Relevant
The plastic conformer is reinserted so that the final steps can be completed,Relevant
A plaster of paris cast is made of the mold of the patient s eye socket,Relevant
After the plaster has hardened about seven minutes the wax and alginate mold is removed and discarded,Relevant
The aluminum iris button has left a hole in the plaster mold into which the painted iris button is placed,Relevant
White plastic is then put into the cast the two halves of the cast are put back together and then placed under pressure and plunged into boiling water,Relevant
This reduces the water temperature and the plastic is thus cured under pressure for about 23 minutes,Relevant
The cast is then removed from the water and cooled,Relevant
The plastic has hardened in the shape of the mold with the painted iris button imbedded in the proper place,Relevant
About 0 5 mm of plastic is then removed from the anterior surface of the prosthesis,Relevant
The white plastic which overlaps the iris button is ground down evenly around the edge of the button,Relevant
This simulates how the sclera of the living eye slightly overlaps the iris,Relevant
The sclera is colored using paints chalk pencils colored thread and a liquid plastic syrup to match the patient s remaining eye,Relevant
Any necessary alterations to the iris color can also be made at this point,Relevant
The prosthesis is then returned to the cast,Relevant
Clear plastic is placed in the anterior half of the cast and the two halves are again joined placed under pressure and returned to the hot water,Relevant
The final processing time is about 30 minutes,Irrelevant
The cast is then removed and cooled and the finished prosthesis is removed,Relevant
Grinding and polishing the prosthesis to a high luster is the final step,Irrelevant
This final polishing is crucial to the ultimate comfort of the patient,Relevant
The prosthesis is finally ready for fitting,Relevant
The manufacturing process is deceptively simple,Irrelevant
Its main function is to trick the extracted fibroblasts into believing that they are in the human body so that they communicate with each other in the natural way to create new skin,Irrelevant
Fibroblasts are thawed and expanded,Relevant
The fibroblasts are transferred from the vials into roller bottles which resemble liter soda bottles,Relevant
The bottles are rotated on their sides for three to four weeks,Relevant
The rolling action allows the circulation of oxygen essential to the growth process,Relevant
The cells are removed from the roller bottles combined with a nutrient rich media flowed through tubes into thin cassette like bioreactors housing the biodegradable mesh scaffolding and sterilized with e beam radiation,Relevant
As the cells flow into the cassettes they adhere to the mesh and begin to grow,Relevant
The cells are flowed back and forth for three to four weeks,Relevant
Each day leftover cell suspension is removed and fresh nutrient is added,Relevant
Oxygen pH nutrient flow and temperature are controlled by the culture system,Relevant
As the new cells create a layer of dermal skin the polymer disintegrates,Relevant
When cell growth on the mesh is completed the tissue is rinsed with more nutrient rich media,Relevant
A cryoprotectant is added,Relevant
Cassettes are stored individually labeled and frozen,Relevant
Cells are transferred to a culture system,Relevant
A small amount of the cold collagen and nutrient media approximately 12% of the combined solution is added to the fibroblasts,Relevant
The mixture is dispensed into molds and allowed to come to room temperature,Relevant
As the collagen warms it gels trapping the fibroblasts and generating the growth of new skin cells,Relevant
Keratinocytes added,Relevant
Two weeks after the collagen is added to the fibroblasts the extracted keratinocytes are thawed and seeded onto the new dermal skin,Relevant
They are allowed to grow for several days and then exposed to air inducing the keratinocytes to form epidermal layers,Relevant
Growth cycle completed,Irrelevant
The new skin is stored in sterile containers until needed,Relevant
Although its componentsaspartic acid phenylalanine and methanoloccur naturally in foods aspartame itself does not and must be manufactured,Irrelevant
NutraSweet aspartame is made through fermentation and synthesis processes,Irrelevant
Direct fermentation produces the starting amino acids needed for the manufacture of aspartame,Irrelevant
In this process specific types of bacteria which have the ability to produce certain amino acids are raised in large quantities,Irrelevant
Over the course of about three days the amino acids are harvested and the bacteria are destroyed,Irrelevant
To start the fermentation process a sample from a pure culture of bacteria is put into a test tube containing the nutrients necessary for its growth,Relevant
After this initial inoculation the bacteria begin to multiply,Relevant
When their population is large enough they are transferred to a seed tank,Relevant
The bacterial strains used to make L aspartic acid and L phenylalanine are B flavum and C glutamicum respectively,Relevant
The seed tank provides an ideal environment for growing more bacteria,Irrelevant
It is filled with the things bacteria need to thrive including warm water and carbohydrate foods like cane molasses glucose or sucrose,Irrelevant
It also has carbon sources like acetic acid alcohols or hydrocarbons and nitrogen sources such as liquid ammonia or urea,Irrelevant
These are required for the bacteria to synthesize large quantities of the desired amino acid,Irrelevant
Other growth factors such as vitamins amino acids and minor nutrients round out seed tank contents,Irrelevant
The seed tank is equipped with a mixer which keeps the growth medium moving and a pump which delivers filtered compressed air,Irrelevant
When enough bacterial growth is present the contents from the seed tank are pumped to the fermentation tank,Relevant
The fermentation tank is essentially a larger version of the seed tank,Irrelevant
It is filled with the same growth media found in the seed tank and also provides a perfect environment for bacterial growth,Irrelevant
Here the bacteria are allowed to grow and produce large quantities of amino acids,Irrelevant
Since pH control is vital for optimal growth ammonia water is added to the tank as necessary,Relevant
When enough amino acid is present the contents of the fermentation tank are transferred out so isolation can begin,Relevant
This process starts with a centrifugal separator which isolates a large portion of the bacterial amino acids,Relevant
The desired amino acid is further segregated and purified in an ion exchange column,Relevant
From this column the amino acids are pumped to a crystallizing tank and then to a crystal separator,Relevant
They are then dried and readied for the synthesis phase of aspartame production,Relevant
Aspartame can be made by various synthetic chemical pathways,Irrelevant
In general phenylalanine is modified by a reaction with methanol and then combined with a slightly modified aspartic acid which eventually forms aspartame,Relevant
The amino acids derived from the fermentation process are initially modified to produce aspartame,Relevant
Phenylalanine is reacted with methanol resulting in a compound called L phenylalanine methyl ester,Relevant
Aspartic acid is also modified in such a way to shield various portions of the molecule from the effects of further reactions,Relevant
One method is by reacting the aspartic acid with substances that result in added benzyl rings to protect these sites,Relevant
This ensures that further chemical reactions will occur only on specific parts of the aspartic acid molecule,Irrelevant
After the amino acids are appropriately modified they are pumped into a reactor tank where they are allowed to mix at room temperature for 24 hours,Relevant
The temperature is then increased to approximately 149 F 65 C and maintained for another 24 hours,Relevant
The reaction is then cooled to room temperature,Relevant
It is diluted with an appropriate solvent and cooled to about 0 F 18 C causing crystallization,Relevant
The crystals are then isolated by filtration and dried,Relevant
These crystals are an intermediate of aspartame which must be further modified,Relevant
The intermediate is converted to aspartame by reacting it with acetic acid,Relevant
This reaction is performed in a large tank filled with an aqueous acid solution a palladium metal catalyst and hydrogen,Relevant
It is thoroughly mixed and allowed to react for about 12 hours,Relevant
The metal catalyst is removed by filtration and the solvent is distilled leaving a solid residue,Relevant
This residue is purified by dissolving it in an aqueous ethanol solution and recrystallizing,Relevant
These crystals are filtered and dried to provide the finished powder aspartame,Relevant
Asphalt pavers are assembled from component parts,Irrelevant
Some of these parts are fabricated in the assembly plant while others are manufactured elsewhere and are shipped to the plant,Irrelevant
All parts are given a primer coat of paint,Relevant
The parts are stored in a warehouse and are brought to various work stations or areas as needed,Relevant
The tractor and the screed are assembled separately,Relevant
The tractor assembly process starts as the mainframe is placed on an air flotation pallet,Relevant
As the assembly proceeds the tractor is manually moved by attaching a compressed air line to the flotation pallet,Relevant
This allows the heavy tractor to float on a thin cushion of air and it can be easily pushed from one work station to another with the help of guide rails in the floor,Relevant
The screed is assembled in a single area and does not move from one work station to another,Relevant
Here is a typical sequence of operation for the assembly of an asphalt paver ,Relevant
The individual pieces of the mainframe are cut to size from steel plate with band saws or by flame cutting,Relevant
The required holes are drilled or punched,Relevant
The pieces are held in position relative to each other using jigs and fixtures,Relevant
They are then welded together with automatic wire fed welders that are programmed to weld along the contour of the joints,Relevant
When it is finished the mainframe looks like the letter H with one long leg on each side to support the tires or tracks and a cross leg in the middle to support the engine which is mounted sideways,Relevant
After the mainframe is welded together it is shot blasted with a stream of high velocity air carrying small steel balls,Relevant
This relieves any stresses in the metal caused by welding and removes any welding spatter,Relevant
The mainframe is then painted with a primer and the paint is allowed to dry,Relevant
The mainframe is placed on an air flotation pallet and is moved to the first work station,Relevant
The feeder conveyor chains and flights are installed first followed by the hydraulic feeder drive motors and the feeder lubrication hoses,Relevant
If the tractor is to have a tracked drive the left and right drive hubs are installed,Relevant
On some models the fuel tank is also installed at this time,Relevant
While the mainframe is in the first work station the engine is being prepared in a separate area,Relevant
The engine is placed on a rolling support stand and the fan oil filters and various sensors are installed at this time,Relevant
The disconnect clutch and pump drive gearbox are bolted to the rear of the engine,Relevant
The gearbox is triangular shaped and has mounting locations for three sets of hydraulic pumps,Relevant
The upper set of pumps provide power for the drive tires or tracks,Relevant
The two lower sets of pumps provide power for the left and right conveyor feeders distribution augers and screed vibrators,Relevant
Each set of pumps consists of two or more pumps sandwiched end to end and running off the same central shaft,Relevant
The mainframe is moved to the next work station,Relevant
The engine is lifted from its support stand with an overhead hoist and is lowered into position crossways on the mainframe,Relevant
It is bolted in place on several hard rubber mounts which act to isolate the engine vibration,Relevant
The radiator is bolted in place and coolant hoses are run between the engine and radiator,Relevant
The left and right distribution auger assemblies are bolted in place and the hydraulic auger drive motors and drive chains are installed,Relevant
The rear hopper pieces are bolted in place as are the hydraulic cylinders to raise and lower the screed leveling arms,Relevant
Various hydraulic hoses and electrical wiring are routed between components,Relevant
In operation a dump truck filled with asphalt backs up to the front of the pover and slowly discharges its load into the paver s hopper,Relevant
As the paver moves forward the feeder conveyors move the asphalt to the rear of the paver and the distribution augers push the asphalt outward to the desired width,Relevant
If the tractor is to have a tracked drive the left and right variable speed hydraulic drive motors and two speed planetary gears are bolted to the drive hubs,Relevant
If the tractor is to have a rubber tired drive the drive axle two speed gearbox and two speed hydraulic drive motor is installed,Relevant
At the next work station the main electrical box is installed the hydraulic tank and valves are installed and connected with hoses and the wiring for the screed and tractor lights are routed,Relevant
As the tractor moves down the assembly line the engine side covers and inlet air cleaner are installed the rear platform and open grate deck are put in place and the operator s control console is mounted,Relevant
Some pavers have two operator s consoles one on each side to give the operator a better view when paving close to curbing or other obstacles,Relevant
Other pavers have a movable console that can slide to one side or the other,Relevant
Any final electrical connections are made at this time,Relevant
The batteries and engine muffler are installed next and the various fluids are added as required,Relevant
If the tractor has a tracked drive the lower bogie wheels are installed at this point,Relevant
The tractor assembly is completed by attaching the screed leveling arns hopper sides engine access doors lights and other exterior components,Relevant
The tires or tracks are installed last,Relevant
The engine is started and the finished tractor is given a preliminary check for proper operation,Relevant
The tractor is washed to remove any grease or oil that may have accumulated on the surfaces during assembly,Relevant
A fluorescent dye is added to the hydraulic oil to help spot any leaks,Relevant
The tractor is then hooked up to an automatic testing machine which cycles it through various electrical and hydraulic functions,Relevant
A computer records the results of these tests for future reference,Relevant
An ultraviolet black light is used to detect leaks in the hydraulic system,Relevant
After the cycle test the tractor is driven outside and given a short functional test to visually inspect its operation,Relevant
If adjustments are required they are made at this time,Relevant
The tractor is then parked awaiting a customer s order,Relevant
The screed is assembled in a separate area from the tractor,Relevant
The frame parts are fabricated and welded together,Relevant
The burner assemblies and hydraulic vibrator motors are installed and plumbed with hoses,Relevant
The burners provide heat along the length of the screed to keep the asphalt from sticking to it,Relevant
The vibrators help provide partial compaction of the asphalt as it is being laid,Relevant
Electrical wiring is routed to the various components,Relevant
The hydraulic actuators to control the side to side slope of the screed are installed last,Relevant
The finished screed is attached to a testing machine that duplicates the functions and controls of a tractor,Relevant
The various screed functionsburner ignition vibrator operation slope control and othersare then tested,Relevant
When a customer orders a paver the I customer may specify one of several models of tractors to be matched with one of several screed designs,Relevant
The tractor which has just a coat of primer paint is now cleaned and given a final coat of paint,Relevant
Any warning labels decorative striping or name plates are then installed,Relevant
The screed is usually painted black because it is in contact with the black oily asphalt,Relevant
The screed is attached to the tractor,Relevant
The electrical wiring burner fuel lines and hydraulic hoses are interconnected,Relevant
The finished paver is then given a final functional test,Relevant
The operator s seat is installed last,Relevant
The parts for the automatic drip coffee maker are typically made by specialized shops,Irrelevant
The digital clocks timers and switches are all purchased from companies that produce those items,Irrelevant
The plastic parts are made at a plastics company and the metal parts at a metal stamping plant,Irrelevant
The manufacture of the actual coffee maker consists of putting all these parts together,Irrelevant
The plastic parts for automatic drip coffee makers are designed by the manufacturer and then outsourced to specialty plastics companies,Irrelevant
The plastics company uses the manufacturer s design to make a mold,Relevant
Then parts are produced by injection molding heated plastic is forced into the mold under pressure cooled and released,Relevant
These parts are then shipped to the manufacturer for assembly,Irrelevant
The metal base plate is made at a specialized metal stamping plant,Irrelevant
A sheet of metal is rolled out and heavy machines punch out the specified shape,Relevant
Then these are shipped to the manufacturer,Relevant
The parts of the coffee maker are put together on an assembly line,Relevant
The electrical components are assembled first,Relevant
These are designed so they can be simply snapped together,Irrelevant
Workers standing at the assembly line each snap in a part as it comes to them and the whole line may have 40 to 80 workers each doing a specialized job,Irrelevant
The timer device is snapped in then the cord,Relevant
The metal warmer plate is snapped on and then the thermostat is wired,Relevant
The heater for the warmer plate is assembled then placed on a a small pallet about the size of an index card,Relevant
The pallets are placed on a conveyer belt that carries them through a sonic welding machine,Relevant
This automatically welds the wiring for the heater,Relevant
Once the internal wiring is complete the rest of the piecesthe housing and the filter reservoirare snapped together,Relevant
Some pieces may be screwed in by workers using pneumatic screw drivers,Relevant
After assembly workers place the coffee makers in small cartons,Relevant
Then workers place these cartons in larger packing cartons which might contain several units,Relevant
These may be taped shut by hand or they may be taped automatically by passing on a conveyor belt through a taping machine,Relevant
Typically another machine automatically imprints a bar code on the packing box for tracking information,Relevant
Then the boxes are stacked on large pallets and shipped or stored in a warehouse,Relevant
Ballpoint pens are made to order in mass quantities,Relevant
While each manufacturer makes them slightly differently the basic steps include ink compounding metal component formation plastic component molding piece assembly packaging labeling and shipping,Irrelevant
In advanced shops pens can go from raw material to finished product in less than five minutes,Irrelevant
Large batches of ink are made in a designated area of the manufacturing plant,Irrelevant
Here workers known as compounders follow formula instructions to make batches of ink,Relevant
Raw materials are poured into the batch tank and thoroughly mixed,Relevant
Depending on the formula these batches can be heated and cooled as necessary to help the raw materials combine more quickly,Relevant
Some of the larger quantity raw materials are pumped and metered directly into the batch tank,Relevant
These materials are added simply by pressing a button on computerized controls,Relevant
These controls also regulate the mixing speeds and the heating and cooling rates,Relevant
Quality control checks are made during different points of ink batching,Relevant
While the ink is being made the metal components of the pen are being constructed,Relevant
The tungsten carbide balls are typically supplied by outside vendors,Relevant
Other parts of the pen such as the point and the body are made using various molds,Irrelevant
First bands of brass are automatically inserted into stamping machines which cut out thousands of small discs,Relevant
The brass discs are next softened and poured into a compression chamber which consists of a steel ram and a spring backed ejector plunger,Relevant
The steel ram presses on the metal causing the plunger to retract and forcing the metal into a die cast mold,Relevant
This compresses the metal and forms the various pen pieces,Relevant
When the ram and plunger return to their original positions the excess metal is then scraped off and recycled,Relevant
The die is then opened and the pen piece is ejected,Relevant
The formed pieces are then cleaned and cut,Relevant
They are immersed in a bath to remove oils used in the molding process,Relevant
After they emerge from the bath the parts are then cut to the dimensions of the specific pen,Relevant
The pen pieces are next polished by rotating brushes and cleaned again to remove any residual oils,Relevant
The ball can then be inserted into the point cavity,Relevant
The plastic components of the pen are constructed simultaneously with the other pen pieces,Relevant
They can be produced by either extrusion or injection molding,Relevant
In each approach the plastic is supplied as granules or powder and is fed into a large hopper,Relevant
The extrusion process involves a large spiral screw which forces the material through a heated chamber making it a thick flowing mass,Relevant
It is then forced through a die cooled and cut,Relevant
Pieces such as the pen body and ink reservoir are made by this method,Irrelevant
For pieces that have more complex shapes like caps ends and mechanical components injection molding is used,Relevant
In this process the plastic is heated converting it into a liquid that can then be forcibly injected into a mold,Relevant
After it cools it solidifies and maintains its shape after the die is opened,Relevant
After the components are formed assembly can take place,Relevant
Typically the ballpoint is first attached to the ink reservoir,Relevant
These pieces are then conveyored to injectors which fill the reservoir with the appropriately colored ink,Relevant
If a spring is going to be present it is then placed on the barrel of the reservoir,Relevant
The point and reservoir are then placed inside the main body of the pen,Relevant
At this stage other components such as the cap and ends are incorporated,Relevant
Other finishing steps such as adding coatings or decorations or performing a final cleaning are also done,Relevant
The finished pens are then packaged according to how they will be sold,Relevant
Single pens can be put into blister packages with cardboard backings,Relevant
Groups of pens are packed into bags or boxes,Relevant
These sales units are then put into boxes stacked on pallets and shipped to distributors,Relevant
The key to manufacturing a successful black box is to make it as indestructible as possible,Irrelevant
This is done by sheathing the components inside a multi layer protective shell,Relevant
The different makers of recorders each have their own proprietary design but in general the manufacturing process can be described as follows The key components the power supply the interface controller board and the memory circuits are built as separate units and then assembled to form the completed black box,Irrelevant
This modular approach allows the components to be easily replaced without disassembly of the entire device,Irrelevant
Each of these components has its own special assembly requirements but primary attention is given to the protecting the memory unit since it contains the data that will be of interest to investigators,Irrelevant
A multi layered configuration is used to ensure the memory unit s integrated circuits are adequately protected,Relevant
The outermost layer is the housing which consists of steel armor plate,Irrelevant
Below that is a layer of insulation followed by a thick slab of paraffin which forms a thermal block,Irrelevant
As the paraffin melts it absorbs heat and therefore keeps the temperature of the memory core lower,Relevant
Beneath the paraffin lies the board containing the memory chips,Irrelevant
Underneath the memory board is another paraffin thermal block followed by another layer of insulation,Irrelevant
The entire assembly is mounted on a steel plate that serves as an access cover,Relevant
The assembled Crash Survivable Memory Unit is then bolted onto the front of a heavy metal plate mounting shelf with four large retaining bolts,Irrelevant
The power supply is attached just behind the CSMU,Relevant
The Interface and Control Circuit Board ICB is attached by screws to the underside of the mounting shelf,Relevant
A metal access cover protects the board and provides easy access,Irrelevant
The Underwater Locator Beacon ULB is affixed to the two arms extending from the front of the memory unit,Relevant
The ULB protrudes from the casing and has a cylindrical shape that allows it to be used as a handle for the entire device,Relevant
If the recorder is to be sold without a ULB a hollow metal handle tube is installed in its place,Relevant
The outer casing is painted bright orange or red to make it more visible in a crash,Relevant
The mainframe core which forms the rigid inner body is cut from steel plate and structural shaped so that it easily resists high impact shock loads and torsional forces normally incurred by the dozer,Relevant
The main structural skeleton formed through the welding of steel plates to machined casting is comprised of two boxed in rail sections connected to the main casing,Irrelevant
The fabrication is normally performed in a fabrication cell where the burned plate arrives ready to be mounted into fixtures and manually or robotically welded to the stationary central casting,Irrelevant
Far too massive to be lifted by hand the frames are then transported by overhead crane to different stations where steel mounting blocks and trunions or cross members are welded on as a support for the other components of the bulldozer,Relevant
Once completed the frame is rotary sanded on all plated surfaces and sent to the paint booth and the main assembly line,Relevant
At the assembly line the independently manufactured diesel engine and transmission join the mainframe,Relevant
The engine is usually purchased completely assembled as it is a complex system with machined components that can be used in many different vehicular applications,Irrelevant
In fact the engine which has been subjected to various performance tests is certified to operate on arrival,Irrelevant
The engine mounts in the front of the bulldozer however it is connected to the transmission which sits in the back,Relevant
The two are connected by a long shaft and supported by couplings and bearings,Relevant
The transmission is then connected to a series of gears and differentials to comprise the rest of the power train,Relevant
By mounting on pads previously welded to the frame the engine transmission assembly can be bolted directly to the base on the main assembly line,Irrelevant
On the front of the bulldozer an engine casing is mounted to support the radiator and hydraulic lifting cylinders,Relevant
The radiator another finished assembly will then sit between the engine casing and mount to the front drive shaft,Irrelevant
Connections can then be made to attach water lines from the engine to the radiator,Relevant
Additional assemblies for the hydraulic lubrication cooling and fuel systems are also constructed at other locations and purchased as a finished assembly ready to be fastened directly to the engine or base,Irrelevant
These include hydraulic lines composed of tubes hoses and fittings pre assembled and mounted on the engine or frame and connected to pumps valves tanks and cylinders each of which can be brought to the main assembly line as a finished component,Irrelevant
Fuel exhaust hydraulic and coolant lines also arrive ready for assembly and mate to other finished components,Irrelevant
Many of these components and sub assemblies must be inspected and approved for dimensional compliance at an incoming inspection station prior to assembly,Relevant
Two distinct features characterize the bulldozer the long vertical steel blade in the front of the vehicle and the rotating twin tracks which facilitate the bulldozer movement,Irrelevant
The blade which can weigh up to 16 000 lb 7 264 kg is useful for pushing material from one spot to another,Irrelevant
As the entire assembly of the frame engine transmission and line groups move along the main production line larger assemblies and components are brought in by overhead cranes overhead conveyors automatic guided vehicles AGV or lift trucks,Irrelevant
These components include the cab larger hydraulic cylinders undercarriage components and the front blade,Relevant
The cab which can also be purchased as a finished assembly is usually manufactured at a different facility and shipped for assembly,Irrelevant
Usually complete in its array of electronics and controls the cab will be mounted on steel blocks or pads located on the dozer frame,Irrelevant
After mounting connections will be made to the various controls and power can supplied to the fully functioning cab,Irrelevant
Concurrent with the engine transmission mounting the undercarriage composed of tubular roller frames drive sprockets and bogey independent suspension rollers will be mounted on the frame and assembled to the drive train,Irrelevant
The axle assembly will turn the outer sprockets that rotate the track allowing the vehicle to maneuver,Irrelevant
The sprockets typically 2 ft 61 cm in diameter will fit into the track with case hardened teeth which move the track as they rotate,Irrelevant
In many manufacturing operations the undercarriage can be machined assembled and painted in the same facility as the main assembly line but various smaller components like bearings and lubrication bushings need to be outsourced to other facilities or outside contractors,Irrelevant
The track which is often pre assembled from machined steel links can be fitted around the drive sprockets rollers and front back guide gears only after the engine transmission and undercarriage components are in place,Irrelevant
The exhaust stack attached directly to the engine is supported by brackets and flanges at its base,Irrelevant
After the cab controls are connected to the engine and hydraulic systems prefabricated cowlings or body panels are mounted directly on the base frame to cover the engine transmission radiator and fluid lines,Relevant
The body panels are designed to fold back making the inside of the dozer easily accessible for regular maintenance,Irrelevant
They are assembled into hinges already fastened to structural supports,Irrelevant
Tooling and storage compartments may also be built into the dozer once the lines have all been connected,Relevant
Deck plates lie around the cabin and are welded to support brackets,Irrelevant
The front blade is attached to hydraulic cylinders which can position the blade at different angles of tilt,Irrelevant
The cylinders each comprised of a hardened steel piston inside a honed cylinder are attached at one end to engine casing in the front of the bulldozer to move the blade vertically,Irrelevant
Initially in the assembly process the cylinders are left unattached at the one end until the roll formed steel blade is assembled and then hydraulic lines can be fitted and tightened,Irrelevant
The lower end of the blade is attached at two joints with large steel pins which rotate and tilt the blade with two more cylinders,Irrelevant
Arms extending from the undercarriage are attached to the blade and then are assembled along with the other undercarriage components,Irrelevant
Once the dozer has been outfitted with its primary components more hoses electrical lines and fluid lines are attached at fitted connections,Relevant
Items such as the batteries which are connected to the starter on the engine lie underneath a cowling in a compartment located near the engine,Relevant
Lights one of the last items installed on the dozer will be placed in a number of different areas and connected to their power source,Relevant
In addition hand or guard rails and foot pegs are bolted on the frame which complete main line assembly,Relevant
At Caterpillar s Track Type Tractor TTT division located in Peoria Illinois Caterpillar bulldozers and crawlers use the same paint and final prep lines as many other tracked vehicles,Irrelevant
Applied manually with spray guns the final paint booth will deliver paint to any area not blocked off with paper or plastic wrapping,Irrelevant
The paint dries quickly and the bulldozer will move to the next station where decals and trim are applied by hand templates,Relevant
Various fluids are added and the vehicle is then sent to a testing station where the operation of all systems is mechanically verified and recorded,Relevant
The vehicle is transported from the manufacturing site to a staging area for customization and shipping,Relevant
The completed bulldozer is shipped on a flat bed trailer and is ready for field operation upon arrival,Relevant
The camera chassis or body and back cover are made of a polycarbonate compound containing 10 20% glass fiber,Irrelevant
This material is very durable lightweight and shock resistant as well as tolerant to humidity and temperature changes,Irrelevant
Its major disadvantage is that it is not resistant to chemicals,Irrelevant
The polycarbonate is molded to very specific tolerances because the internal workings of the camera must fit precisely to work well and to use the strength of the chassis for protection against jarring and other shocks to which mechanical and electronic parts are sensitive,Relevant
After the chassis is molded and assembled it becomes the frame to which other parts of the camera like electrical connections in the battery housing and the auto focus module are attached,Relevant
The shutter assembly and film transport system are manufactured on a separate assembly line,Irrelevant
These parts are largely mechanical although the film transport system has electronics to read the speed of the film,Irrelevant
DX film coding appears as silver bands on the roll of film and these are detected by multiple contacts in the film chamber,Relevant
More advanced cameras have microchips that see the data imprinted in the silver bands and adjust shutter speed flash and other camera actions,Relevant
Again all parts are precisely made the film magazine size must be accurate to 60 thousandths of an inch,Relevant
The shutter functions like a curtain that opens and closes,Irrelevant
It must operate exactly to expose the film for the correct length of time and to coordinate with other operations such as the flash,Irrelevant
The shutter is made of different materials depending on the type of camera and manufacturer,Irrelevant
The viewfinder lens is a specialized lens that is manufactured using the same methods as a camera lens,Irrelevant
The viewfinder also is made of optical glass plastic or glass plastic combinations,Irrelevant
All but the simplest viewfinders contain reticles that illuminate a frame and other information on the eyelens to help the photographer frame the picture,Irrelevant
An in line mirror has specialized coatings for color splitting as many as 17 coatings may be added to the mirror to correct and modify its reflective properties,Relevant
Single lens reflex SLR cameras have through the lens viewing capabilities and are also called real image viewfinders because they let the photographer see as the lens sees,Irrelevant
The SLR viewfinder uses a prism to bend the light from the lens to the photographer s eye and the prism is made of optical glass to precise requirements to make the correct view possible,Relevant
Advanced cameras and most compact models include a liquid crystal display LCD screen that provides information to the photographer such as film speed aperture photographic mode including landscape portrait close up and other modes count of photos taken operation of redeye and flash and other accessories battery condition and other data regarding the camera s workings,Relevant
Integrated circuitry is constructed Cameraas subassemblies for the electronic brains of the camera and attached flash if any,Irrelevant
CAT scanner manufacture is typically an assembly of various components that are supplied by outside manufacturers,Irrelevant
The following process discusses how the major components are produced,Irrelevant
The x ray tube is made much like other types of electrical diodes,Irrelevant
The individual components including the cathode and anode are placed inside the tube envelope and vacuum sealed,Relevant
The tube is then situated into the protective housing which can then be attached to the rotating portion of the scanner frame,Relevant
Various detector arrays are available for CAT scanners,Irrelevant
One type of detector array is the ideal gas filled detector,Irrelevant
This is made by placing strips of tungsten 0 04 inch 1 mm apart around a large metallic frame,Relevant
A ceramic substrate holds the strips in place,Irrelevant
The entire assembly is hermetically sealed and pressure filled with an inert gas such as xenon,Relevant
Each of the tiny chambers formed by the gaps between the tungsten plates are individual detectors,Irrelevant
The finished detector is also attached to the scanner frame,Relevant
To create the large amount of voltage needed to produce x rays an autotransformer is used,Irrelevant
This power supply device is made by winding wire around a core,Relevant
Electric tap connections are made at various points along the coil and connected to the main power source,Relevant
With this device output voltage can be increased to approximately twice the input voltage,Irrelevant
The control consol and computer are specially designed and supplied by computer manufacturers,Irrelevant
The primary model building computer is specifically programmed with the reconstruction algorithms needed to manipulate the x ray data from the gantry assembly,Irrelevant
The control consoles are also programmed with software to control the administration of the CAT scan,Irrelevant
The final assembly of the CAT scanner is a custom process which often takes place in the radiologic imaging facility,Relevant
Rooms are specially designed to house each component and minimize the potential for excessive radiation exposure or electric shock,Relevant
By following specific plans equipment installation and wiring of the entire CAT scanner system is completed,Relevant
Grain is received at the cereal factory inspected and cleaned,Relevant
It may be used in the form of whole grains or it may require further processing,Irrelevant
Often the whole grain is crushed between large metal rollers to remove the outer layer of bran,Relevant
It may then be ground more finely into flour,Relevant
Whole grains or partial grains such as corn grits are mixed with flavoring agents vitamins minerals sweeteners salt and water in a large rotating pressure cooker,Relevant
The time temperature and speed of rotation vary with the type of grain being cooked,Irrelevant
The cooked grain is moved to a conveyor belt which passes through a drying oven,Relevant
Enough of the water remains in the cooked grain to result in a soft solid mass which can be shaped as needed,Relevant
If flour is used instead of grains it is cooked in a cooking extruder,Relevant
This device consists of a long screw within a heated housing,Relevant
The motion of the screw mixes the flour with water flavorings salt sweeteners vitamins minerals and sometimes food coloring,Relevant
The screw moves this mixture through the extruder cooking it as it moves along,Relevant
At the end of the extruder the cooked dough emerges as a ribbon,Relevant
A rotating knife cuts the ribbon into pellets,Relevant
These pellets are then processed in much the same way as cooked grains,Relevant
The cooked grains are allowed to cool for several hours stabilizing the moisture content of each grain,Relevant
This process is known as tempering,Irrelevant
The tempered grains are flattened between large metal rollers under tons of pressure,Relevant
The resulting flakes are conveyed to ovens where they are tossed in a blast of very hot air to remove remaining moisture and to toast them to a desirable color and flavor,Relevant
Instead of cooked grains flakes may also be made from extruded pellets in a similar manner,Relevant
Cereals may be puffed in ovens or in so called guns,Irrelevant
Oven puffed cereals are usually made from rice,Irrelevant
The rice is cooked cooled and dried,Relevant
It is then rolled between metal rollers like flaked cereals but it is only partially flattened,Relevant
This process is known as bumping,Irrelevant
The bumped rice is dried again and placed in a very hot oven which causes it to swell,Relevant
Gun puffed cereals may be made from rice or wheat,Irrelevant
The rice grains require no pretreatment but the wheat grains must be treated to partially remove the outer layer of bran,Relevant
This may be done by abrading it off between grindstones a process known as pearling,Relevant
It may also be done by soaking the wheat grains in salt water,Relevant
The salt water toughens the bran which allows it to break off in large pieces during puffing,Irrelevant
The grain is placed in the gun a small vessel which can hold very hot steam and very high pressure,Relevant
The gun is opened quickly to reduce the pressure suddenly which puffs the grain,Relevant
Extruded pellets can also be used to make gun puffed cereals in the same way as grains,Relevant
Shredded cereals are usually made from wheat,Irrelevant
The wheat is cooked in boiling water to allow moisture to fully penetrate the grain,Relevant
The cooked grain is cooled and allowed to temper,Relevant
It is then rolled between two metal rollers,Relevant
One roller is smooth and the other is grooved,Irrelevant
A metal comb is positioned against the grooved roll with a tooth inside each groove,Irrelevant
The cooked grain is shredded by the teeth of the comb and drops off the rollers in a continuous ribbon,Relevant
A conveyor belt catches the ribbons from several pairs of rollers and piles them up in layers,Relevant
The layers of shredded wheat are cut to the proper size then baked to the desired color and dryness,Relevant
Shredded cereals may also be made in a similar way from extruded pellets,Irrelevant
Cereals can be made in a wide variety of special shapes circles letters of the alphabet etc with a cooking extruder,Relevant
A die is added to the end of the extruder which forms a ribbon of cooked dough with the desired cross section shape,Relevant
A rotating knife cuts the ribbon into small pieces with the proper shape,Relevant
These shaped pieces of dough are processed in a manner similar to puffing,Relevant
Instead of completely puffing however the pieces expand only partially in order to maintain the special shape,Irrelevant
Granolas and similar products are made by mixing grain usually oats and other ingredients nuts fruits flavors etc and cooking them on a conveyor belt which moves through an oven,Irrelevant
The cooked mixture is then crumbled to the desired size,Relevant
Hot cereals are made by processing the grain as necessary rolling or cutting oats cracking wheat or milling corn into grits and partly cooking it so the consumer can cook it quickly in hot water,Relevant
Salt sweeteners flavors and other ingredients may or may not be added to the partly cooked mixture,Relevant
After shaping the cereal may be coated with vitamins minerals sweeteners flavors such as fruit juices food colors or preservatives,Relevant
Frosting is applied by spraying a thick hot syrup of sugar on the cereal in a rotating drum,Relevant
As it cools the syrup dries into a white layer of frosting,Relevant
Some cereals such as shredded wheat are fairly resistant to damage from moisture,Irrelevant
They may be placed directly into cardboard boxes or in cardboard boxes lined with plastic,Relevant
Most cereals must be packaged in airtight waterproof plastic bags within cardboard boxes to protect them from spoiling,Relevant
An automated machine packages the cereal at a rate of about 40 boxes per minute,Relevant
The box is assembled from a flat sheet of cardboard which has been previously printed with the desired pattern for the outside of the box,Relevant
The bottom and sides of the box are sealed with a strong glue,Relevant
The bag is formed from moisture proof plastic and inserted into the box,Relevant
The cereal fills the bag and the bag is tightly sealed by heat,Relevant
The top of the box is sealed with a weak glue which allows the consumer to open it easily,Relevant
The completed boxes of cereal are packed into cartons which usually hold 12 24 or 36 boxes and shipped to the retailer,Relevant
The grapes are carefully loaded into the press a square wooden floor surrounded by adjustable wooden rails and topped by a heavy oak lid,Relevant
The lid is mechanically lowered and raised at intervals causing the grapes to burst and the juice to pour out,Relevant
The juices run through the rails into a sloped groove that carries the juice to stainless steel vats,Relevant
The first pressing is called the cuvee and is the best juice from a batch of grapes,Irrelevant
It is kept separate from subsequent pressings,Relevant
The cuvee begins to ferment immediately,Relevant
As scum rises to the top it is thrown off,Relevant
Some of the scum falls to the bottom of the vat this sediment is called lees,Irrelevant
The juice called must continues to ferment for 24 36 hours when it gradually returns to its normal temperature,Relevant
The cuves are moved into temperature controlled stainless steels vats and fermented for several weeks at 64 68 F 18 20 C ,Relevant
The amount of time varies depending on the house specifications,Irrelevant
Some champagne producers also put the wine through a malolactic fermentation process at this point to reduce acidity,Relevant
The head cellarer chefde caves and cellar assistants taste and blend wines from several different pressings to obtain the desired taste,Relevant
The blended wines are churned in vats by sweeping mechanical arms,Relevant
The blended wine is drawn off into bottles,Relevant
The liquer de tirage is added and the bottles are sealed with crown caps,Relevant
Because the carbonic acid cannot escape through the glass it builds up to a tremendous pressure equal to that in a bus tire,Irrelevant
French law requires that non vintage wines be aged for at least one year,Irrelevant
Vintage wines must be aged for at least three years,Irrelevant
Each wine house adds to this minimum requirement as desired,Irrelevant
Non vintage wines are those that result from a thin harvest and are combined with reserves from past good vintages,Irrelevant
Non vintage wine is not sold under a particular year,Irrelevant
Vintage wines on the other hand are made from Champagne grapes harvested in the same year,Irrelevant
Vintage wines are rare produced only when the summer has been unusually hot and sunny,Irrelevant
The year is printed on the cork and the label,Relevant
During the aging period the bottles of champagne are turned daily to keep the sediment caused by dead yeast cells from settling on the bottom,Relevant
Skilled workers with quick hands twist the bottles one eighth of a turn each day,Relevant
The bottles start out in the horizontal position by the end of the aging period the bottles are vertical with the necks pointed towards the floor so that the sediment has collected on the inside face of the cork,Relevant
The bottleneck is plunged into freezing liquid causing a pellet of frozen champagne to form in the neck,Relevant
The crown cap is carefully removed and the ice expels the sediment,Relevant
Liquor d expedition is added 8 The mixture of reserve wines sugar and brandy is added to the bottles of champagne to create the desired sweetness,Relevant
A long fat cork that has been branded with the house name is hand driven halfway into the bottleneck,Relevant
Then the exposed portion is squashed down into the neck and secured with a wire muzzle,Relevant
The bottles are labelled and stored in the cellar until shipment at which time they are packed into crates or cartons,Relevant
Tobacco plants are seeded indoors and transplanted into fields after six to 10 weeks,Relevant
The plants are carefully pruned so the leaves grow to the necessary size,Relevant
Plants that produce the outer wrappers of cigars are usually kept covered with cloth to protect them from the sun,Irrelevant
The plants take several months to mature in the fields,Irrelevant
After harvesting the tobacco leaves must be cured in order to develop their characteristic aroma,Relevant
The leaves are cured when they have passed from bright green flexible fresh leaves to dried brown or yellowish leaves,Relevant
Chemically the naturally occurring chlorophyll in the leaf gradually breaks down and is replaced by carotene,Relevant
To cure the harvested plants are strung to narrow strips of wood called laths,Relevant
The laths are hung from the ceiling of a well ventilated curing barn,Relevant
In dry weather they may cure simply by hanging a process called air curing,Irrelevant
The leaves may also be flue cured,Irrelevant
In this method the laths are hung in a small barn which is heated from 90 170 F 32 2 77 C ,Relevant
The temperature must be carefully monitored in order to prevent extreme rapid drying,Relevant
Sawdust or hardwood may also be burned in the curing barn to aid in drying the leaves and impart an aroma,Relevant
After the leaves are cured they are sorted by color and size,Relevant
Small or broken leaves are used for the cigar filler large leaves for the inner wrapper or binder and large fine leaves usually grown in shade or under cloth are set aside for the outer wrapper,Relevant
The leaves are tied into bundles called hands of 10 or 15 leaves each,Relevant
The hands are packed in boxes or in large casks called hogsheads,Relevant
The tobacco is kept in the hogshead for a period of from six months to five years,Relevant
The leaves undergo chemical changes during this period referred to as fermentation,Relevant
During fermentation the aroma and taste of the leaf develops,Irrelevant
Cigar tobacco is usually fermented longer than Cigarother tobacco,Irrelevant
Fermentation for two to five years is typical for high quality cigars,Irrelevant
After fermentation the leaves are manually sorted again by highly trained workers,Relevant
The filler leaves must have their main vein or stem removed or else the cigar will not burn evenly,Relevant
This can be done by hand or machine,Irrelevant
Manually a worker with a thimble knife fitted to his or her finger clips the vein near the tip and pulls it down,Relevant
Then the worker stacks the stripped leaves in piles called books or pads ,Relevant
Mechanically a worker inserts the tobacco leaves into a machine under a grooved circular knife,Relevant
By depressing a foot treadle the worker causes the knife to lower and cut out the vein,Relevant
The worker can stop the machine with the foot treadle and stack the stripped leaves,Relevant
The stripped leaves are wrapped in bales and stored for further fermentation,Relevant
The bales may be shipped at this point if final production resides elsewhere,Relevant
Just before the leaves are ready for manufacture into cigars they are steamed to restore lost humidity and sorted again,Relevant
Fine cigars are rolled by hand,Relevant
Cigar rolling is skilled work it may take a year for a roller to become proficient,Irrelevant
The filler must be packed evenly for the cigar to burn smoothly and the wrapper should be wound in an even spiral around the cigar,Relevant
Hand cigar makers usually work in small factories,Irrelevant
Each worker sits at a small table with a tray of sorted tobacco leaves on it and space to roll out the cigar,Irrelevant
First the worker selects from two to six leaves for the filler,Relevant
These are placed one on top of the other and rolled into a bunch,Relevant
Then the worker places the bunch on the binder leaf and rolls the binder leaf cylindrically around the filler,Relevant
The unfinished cigars are placed in an open wooden mold that holds them in shape until they can be wrapped,Relevant
Wrapping is the most difficult step,Irrelevant
The worker takes the partially completed cigar out of the mold and places it on the wrapper leaf,Relevant
With a special rounded knife called a chaveta the worker trims off any irregularities from the filler,Relevant
Then the worker rolls the wrapper leaf around the filler and binder three and a half times and secures it at the end with a small amount of vegetable paste,Relevant
The worker cuts a small round piece out of a different wrapper leaf,Relevant
This is sometimes done by tracing around a coin,Relevant
This circle is then attached to the end of the cigar with paste,Relevant
The worker has completed the cigar though it still must be tested sorted and packed,Relevant
Cigars come in several shapes and sizes,Irrelevant
Perfecto refers to a cigar with a pointed head and tapering sides Panatella is a long thin straight cigar Cheroot is an open ended cigar usually made in India or Asia,Irrelevant
From the smallest [3 5 in 18 9 cm ] to the largest [7 5 in 19 cm ] cigars are labeled the Half Corona Tres Petit Corona Petit Corona Corona Corona Grande Lonsdale and Double Corona,Irrelevant
Cigars may be made by hand in teams,Irrelevant
Some workers may make the bunch and wrap it in the binder and then the more delicate finishing work of rolling the wrapper is left to more skilled workers,Irrelevant
The majority of cigars are made today by machine,Irrelevant
A typical cigar machine may require several workers to tend to its different functions,Irrelevant
One worker feeds tobacco leaves onto a feed belt between guide bars that are adjusted for the length of cigar desired,Relevant
The machine bunches the leaves forming the filler,Relevant
A second worker places binder leaf or HTL onto the binder die,Relevant
The leaf is held down by suction and the machine cuts it to the proper size,Relevant
The filler then drops onto the binder die,Relevant
The machine rolls the binder around the filler,Relevant
A third worker places the wrapper leaf or HTL on a wrapper die,Relevant
The partially completed cigar drops onto the wrapper die and the machine rolls the wrapper around the cigar,Relevant
A fourth worker inspects the completed cigars and places them in trays,Relevant
The finished cigars are passed to an examiner,Relevant
The examiner inspects the cigars for imperfections and checks them for proper weight size shape and condition of the wrapper,Relevant
The examiner may correct imperfections by patching wrappers or re shaping heads,Relevant
Cigars that pass inspection are placed on trays and passed to a banding and wrapping machine,Relevant
A worker places the cigars in a hopper and the machine places a band around them,Relevant
The same machine may also wrap the cigars in cellophane,Relevant
The ringed cigars may be also passed to workers expert in sorting by shade,Relevant
They sort the finished cigars according to minute variations in wrapper color,Relevant
Cigars with the same wrapper shade are then boxed together,Relevant
When wood is harvested for clarinet making logs are sawed to between 3 4 ft 1 1 2 m in length,Relevant
The logs must be seasoned to prevent later warping,Irrelevant
They may be seasoned by being kept in the open air for several months or they may be dried in a kiln,Relevant
Then the logs are split and sawed to lengths approximating the finished lengths of the clarinet body pieces upper and lower joints barrel and bell ,Relevant
The body pieces look like narrow rectangular blocks and pieces for the barrel are carved in a rough pyramidal shape,Relevant
These pieces are known as billets,Irrelevant
The manufacturer buys the billets in lots and begins the manufacturing process from these roughed out shapes,Relevant
When the manufacturer receives the billets workers inspect the lot,Relevant
Then skilled workers place the billets on a borer which drills a hole lengthwise through the center of each piece,Relevant
The diameter and shape of this hole called the bore of the clarinet is crucial to determining the tone of the instrument,Irrelevant
The bore may be drilled in a straight cylinder or the cylinder may be slightly tapered,Relevant
After the bore is drilled the body pieces are turned on a lathe,Relevant
The rectangular billets become smooth round hollow cylinders,Irrelevant
These cylinders are then seasoned again,Relevant
After the rough pieces have been seasoned for the second time they are reduced to finished size,Relevant
The pieces are turned on a lathe and trimmed to exceedingly precise diameters,Relevant
The joints where the body pieces fit into each other are turned after the exterior is completed,Relevant
The bore may be reamed more precisely and then it is polished on the inside,Relevant
Then the joints are painted with a black dye,Relevant
Body parts for clarinets made of plastic are produced by injection molding,Relevant
Plastic pellets are melted and forced under pressure into molds,Relevant
The molds for clarinet body parts produce hollow cylinders,Relevant
In some cases the molds are so precise that these cylinders do not need any additional reaming,Irrelevant
Or they may be reamed and polished as are wooden clarinets,Relevant
The steps that follow apply to both wooden and plastic models,Irrelevant
Next the maker bores the tone holes that the player s fingers cover to make the different notes,Relevant
The most common method for mass produced clarinets is to set the body pieces in a setting out machine,Irrelevant
This is a table which holds the piece on a mount under a vertical drill,Irrelevant
The holes are drilled at specified distances apart and with precise diameters,Relevant
The exact dimension of the holes affects the tuning of the instrument and the holes may be adjusted after the instrument is nearly complete,Relevant
Not every hole is the same size and the maker may have to insert a different drill bit for each hole,Relevant
The holes are smaller on the outside than on the inside and to achieve their precise shape after the holes are drilled they are undercut,Relevant
The clarinet maker uses a small flared tool placed in the tone hole to expand the underside of the hole,Relevant
Next to the tone holes tiny holes for holding the key mechanism are also drilled,Relevant
Early clarinets were made with hand forged keys,Irrelevant
The modern method is usually die casting,Irrelevant
Molten alloy usually German silver is forced under pressure into steel dies,Relevant
A group of connected keys may be made in one piece in this method,Relevant
Alternately individual keys may be stamped out by a heavy stamping machine and then trimmed,Relevant
These individual keys are then soldered together with silver solder to make the connected group,Relevant
Next the keys are polished,Relevant
Keys for inexpensive models may be placed in a tumbling machine where friction and agitation of pellets in a revolving drum polish the pieces,Relevant
More expensive keys may be buffed individually by being held against the rotating wheel of a polishing machine,Relevant
Some keys may be silver plated and then polished,Relevant
There are two main clarinet key systems in use,Irrelevant
The simple or Albert system is used principally in German speaking countries,Irrelevant
The Bohm system has more keys than the Albert and is standard in most other parts of the world,Irrelevant
The keys are then fitted with pads,Relevant
The pads are usually made of several layerscardboard felt and skin or leather,Irrelevant
The circular pads are stamped or cut and then workers glue them by hand into the head of the key,Relevant
This will muffle the sound of the tone hole closing when the instrument is played,Relevant
The keys are drilled and then fitted with springs that will keep them either open or closed,Relevant
These springs are made of fine steel wire,Irrelevant
The keys are mounted on small pillars called posts,Relevant
The posts are first set in the holes previously drilled for them,Relevant
In many models the posts are threaded and they can be simply screwed in by hand,Irrelevant
Using a very small drill bit tiny holes are then drilled in the posts to hold the needle springs,Relevant
Then the keys are screwed into the posts with stainless steel hinge rods,Relevant
The assembler uses a fine screwdriver pliers and a small leather mallet to fit the keys and adjust the spring action,Relevant
The assembler also checks that the tone holes are covered completely by the key pad inserting a tiny pick under the pad on each side,Relevant
The pad may need to be adjusted or reset or the assembler may clamp a key shut temporarily to set the crease for a perfect airtight closure,Relevant
The joints of the body pieces are lined with cork and waxed so that the pieces fit smoothly into each other,Relevant
The ends of the body pieces are fitted with decorative metal rings as is the bottom of the barrel,Relevant
The barrel is usually embossed with the name of the maker,Relevant
The mouthpiece manufactured separately out of hard rubber is fitted to the instrument,Relevant
When a reed is inserted the instrument can be played for the first time,Relevant
The production of concrete blocks consists of four basic processes mixing molding curing and cubing,Irrelevant
Some manufacturing plants produce only concrete blocks while others may produce a wide variety of precast concrete products including blocks flat paver stones and decorative landscaping pieces such as lawn edging,Irrelevant
Some plants are capable of producing 2 000 or more blocks per hour,Irrelevant
The following steps are commonly used to manufacture concrete blocks,Irrelevant
The sand and gravel are stored outside in piles and are transferred into storage bins in the plant by a conveyor belt as they are needed,Relevant
The portland cement is stored outside in large vertical silos to protect it from moisture,Relevant
As a production run starts the required amounts of sand gravel and cement are transferred by gravity or by mechanical means to a weigh batcher which measures the proper amounts of each material,Relevant
The dry materials then flow into a stationary mixer where they are blended together for several minutes,Relevant
There are two types of mixers commonly used,Irrelevant
One type called a planetary or pan mixer resembles a shallow pan with a lid,Irrelevant
Mixing blades are attached to a vertical rotating shaft inside the mixer,Irrelevant
The other type is called a horizontal drum mixer,Irrelevant
It resembles a coffee can turned on its side and has mixing blades attached to a horizontal rotating shaft inside the mixer,Irrelevant
After the dry materials are blended a small amount of water is added to the mixer,Relevant
If the plant is located in a climate subject to temperature extremes the water may first pass through a heater or chiller to regulate its temperature,Relevant
Admixture chemicals and coloring pigments may also be added at this time,Relevant
The concrete is then mixed for six to eight minutes,Irrelevant
Once the load of concrete is thoroughly mixed it is dumped into an inclined Concrete Blockbucket conveyor and transported to an elevated hopper,Relevant
The mixing cycle begins again for the next load,Irrelevant
From the hopper the concrete is conveyed to another hopper on top of the block machine at a measured flow rate,Relevant
In the block machine the concrete is forced downward into molds,Relevant
The molds consist of an outer mold box containing several mold liners,Irrelevant
The liners determine the outer shape of the block and the inner shape of the block cavities,Relevant
As many as 15 blocks may be molded at one time,Relevant
When the molds are full the concrete is compacted by the weight of the upper mold head coming down on the mold cavities,Relevant
This compaction may be supplemented by air or hydraulic pressure cylinders acting on the mold head,Relevant
Most block machines also use a short burst of mechanical vibration to further aid compaction,Relevant
The compacted blocks are pushed down and out of the molds onto a flat steel pallet,Relevant
The pallet and blocks are pushed out of the machine and onto a chain conveyor,Relevant
In some operations the blocks then pass under a rotating brush which removes loose material from the top of the blocks,Relevant
The pallets of blocks are conveyed to an automated stacker or loader which places them in a curing rack,Relevant
Each rack holds several hundred blocks,Irrelevant
When a rack is full it is rolled onto a set of rails and moved into a curing kiln,Relevant
The kiln is an enclosed room with the capacity to hold several racks of blocks at a time,Irrelevant
There are two basic types of curing kilns,Irrelevant
The most common type is a low pressure steam kiln,Irrelevant
In this type the blocks are held in the kiln for one to three hours at room temperature to allow them to harden slightly,Relevant
Steam is then gradually introduced to raise the temperature at a controlled rate of not more than 60 F per hour 16 C per hour ,Relevant
Standard weight blocks are usually cured at a temperature of 150 165 F 66 74 C while lightweight blocks are cured at 170 185 F 77 85 C ,Relevant
When the curing temperature has been reached the steam is shut off and the blocks are allowed to soak in the hot moist air for 12 18 hours,Relevant
After soaking the blocks are dried by exhausting the moist air and further raising the temperature in the kiln,Relevant
The whole curing cycle takes about 24 hours,Irrelevant
Another type of kiln is the high pressure steam kiln sometimes called an autoclave,Irrelevant
In this type the temperature is raised to 300 375 F 149 191 C and the pressure is raised to 80 185 psi 5 4453 5 8 bar ,Relevant
The blocks are allowed to soak for five to 10 hours,Relevant
The pressure is then rapidly vented which causes the blocks to quickly release their trapped moisture,Relevant
The autoclave curing process requires more energy and a more expensive kiln but it can produce blocks in less time,Irrelevant
The racks of cured blocks are rolled out of the kiln and the pallets of blocks are unstacked and placed on a chain conveyor,Relevant
The blocks are pushed off the steel pallets and the empty pallets are fed back into the block machine to receive a new set of molded blocks,Relevant
If the blocks are to be made into split face blocks they are first molded as two blocks joined together,Relevant
Once these double blocks are cured they pass through a splitter which strikes them with a heavy blade along the section between the two halves,Relevant
This causes the double block to fracture and form a rough stone like texture on one face of each piece,Relevant
The blocks pass through a cuber which aligns each block and then stacks them into a cube three blocks across by six blocks deep by three or four blocks high,Relevant
These cubes are carried outside with a forklift and placed in storage,Relevant
The irritant that is surgically implanted in an oyster as the nucleus of the pearl is made from the shell of a mussel,Irrelevant
As many as ten different mussel species including the American pigtoe mussel and the washboard mussel are used because their shells are as much as an inch thick near the hinge,Irrelevant
Twenty of these beads or nuclei called kaku in Japanese can be carved from one mussel shell,Irrelevant
In a cultured pearl this nucleus is the major portion of the pearl because the pearl coating is relatively thin,Irrelevant
Many of the nuclei are manufactured in Tennessee where the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers host the source mussels,Irrelevant
Baby oysters called spat are born in hatcheries and grown in tanks at the pearl farms,Irrelevant
They are matured in baskets in ocean waters maricultured after they are 60 days old and after they have grown stronger after spending three years in the water they are large enough to withstand removal and implanting,Irrelevant
To implant the nuclei harvested oysters are taken inside pearl farm operating rooms and held together on racks,Relevant
When each is removed from the crowd its shell opens slightly a wedge is inserted so the shell stays open and an operator opens the shell wider to insert the bead,Relevant
A cut is made in the oyster s body and the nucleus is inserted along with a tiny cutting of the mantle of another oyster that is sacrificed for the process,Relevant
The mantle insert stimulates the production of nacre which is excreted by the mantle of the host animal,Relevant
The oysters are then returned to the water by stringing them on plastic garlands or placing them in oyster baskets suspended from rafts,Relevant
While the oysters are in the water the pearl exterior forms over time and fluctuates with water temperature and other conditions,Irrelevant
A porous layer called the conchiolin forms around the nucleus and under the nacre,Irrelevant
The nacre consists of micro layers of a specialized form of the mineral calcium carbonate called aragonite,Irrelevant
The layers are composed of microscopic plates that make cultured pearls feel rough when they are rubbed against the teetha test to distinguish simulated or imitation pearls from natural and cultured gems,Irrelevant
The oysters are harvested some time later depending on the desired finished diameter of the pearl in winter when cold water slows nacre production and also creates the best color luster and orient which is the ability of the pearl to reflect light,Irrelevant
The time of culturing typically ranges from one to three years and the progress of pearl growth inside the oysters can be monitored with x rays,Irrelevant
The pearls are carefully cut out of the oyster s flesh at the pearl farm and productive oysters can be reseeded several times to produce larger pearls as the oysters continue to grow,Relevant
The extracted pearls are processed for sale,Irrelevant
Typically the better specimens of pearls are sold in bulk at auctions regulated by governments,Irrelevant
From auctions the pearls move to dealers then jewelers,Relevant
The pearl farm may also drill and string its pearls for sale,Irrelevant
Jewelry fasteners are usually added at another factory,Relevant
Design of pearls seems an unlikely possibility but in fact a wide variety of colors and shapes exist even through they are extensions of the natural process,Irrelevant
The Chinese began pearl design in the twelfth century by cementing tiny Buddhas carved from wood stone or ivory or cast from metal inside the shells of freshwater mussels,Irrelevant
The Buddhas became coated with nacre or pearlized and were a successful product,Irrelevant
This practice still thrives in Chinese pearl culturing,Irrelevant
The same general technique is used to make half pearls called mabes,Irrelevant
A molded or cut half shape is planted against the oyster s shell after it becomes coated and is removed the half pearl can be mounted on a jewelry backing like an earring,Relevant
In color Japanese pearls range naturally from pink to blue to greenish yellow,Irrelevant
Pearls are bleached to lighten these colors and eliminate any surface staining,Relevant
Colored pearls are made by injecting dye into the porous conchiolin and the pearl must be drilled to be dyed,Relevant
The most exotic designer pearls are probably the large black pearls cultured in Australia and the South Seas,Irrelevant
They are grown in the largest pearl oysters in the world and a perfect specimen of black pearl can sell in the United States for $40 000,Irrelevant
Black pearls also display a natural range of colors from silver to green pearls called peacocks and white,Irrelevant
Shape is also designed not only by creating pearlized molds but through culturing of Cultured Pearlfreshwater pearls,Irrelevant
These come in irregular shapes determined by the piece of mantle inserted to stimulate growth of a pearl,Irrelevant
Human intervention is visible in these designs because the implanter s skill influences the shape of the resulting pearl,Irrelevant
The production of a dental drill is an integrated process in which individual components are first made and then assembled to make the final product,Irrelevant
While manufacturers could make each part individually they usually depend on outside suppliers for many of the parts,Irrelevant
A typical production method would include constructing the motors and the drill bits forming the handpiece final assembly and packaging,Irrelevant
Although numerous designs and materials are used to make the handpiece they are all typically made using a pre formed mold,Irrelevant
For plastic handpieces this involves injection molding a process in which the plastic is melted injected into a mold and released after it forms,Irrelevant
Metal handpieces also use a similar molding process,Irrelevant
The drill bits are formed from tungsten carbide particles,Relevant
They are made by first taking tungsten ore and chemically processing it to produce tungsten oxides,Irrelevant
Hydrogen is then added to the system to remove the oxygen resulting in a fine tungsten metal powder,Relevant
This powder is then blended with carbon and heated producing tungsten carbide particles of varying sizes,Relevant
These particles are further processed to form the appropriately shaped drill bit,Relevant
The air turbine engine is constructed from small steel components,Irrelevant
In one design the turbine is sandwiched between two sets of ball raced bearings and connected directly to the drill bit,Relevant
The entire unit is encased in the drill head with openings for incoming air and exhaust air,Relevant
Other types of turbine engines are farther up in the handpiece and are connected to the drill bit by a series of driveshafts and gears,Relevant
The low powered motors are put together much like the air turbine engines,Relevant
The rotary vane air powered motor consists of a core structure with sliding vanes protruding outward,Irrelevant
It is placed in the handpiece and connected to the main driveshaft of the drill,Relevant
It also has an opening for incoming and outgoing air,Irrelevant
Electric motors are significantly Dental Drillmore complex consisting of a set of bearings magnets brushes and armature coils,Irrelevant
After all the components are available final assembly can begin,Irrelevant
Depending on the design the air turbine can be placed directly into casing of the handpiece or it can be attached along with the drill bit,Relevant
The other parts of the drill are put into the handpiece including air or electric motors driveshaft gears and control switches,Relevant
Other accessories are added such as the cooling hoses and fiber optic lighting devices,Relevant
The coupler is placed on one end of the handpiece and the drill bit is attached to the other,Relevant
After an array of quality checks the finished drills are placed in the appropriate packaging along with accessories manuals and replacement parts and are then shipped to distributors,Relevant
The manufacturing process begins with a preliminary impression of the patient s mouth which is usually done in wax,Irrelevant
This impression is used to prepare a diagnostic cast,Relevant
While making the impression the dentist applies pressure to the soft tissues to simulate biting force and extends the borders of the mold to adjacent toothless areas to allow the dentures to better adapt to the gums,Relevant
Once an appropriate preliminary cast has been obtained the final cast is cast from gypsum a stone like product,Relevant
The final mold is inspected and approved before using it to manufacture the teeth,Relevant
After the mold has been cast it is filled with acrylic resin to form the denture,Relevant
The mold is prepared with a release agent prior to adding the resin to ensure that the hardened acrylic can be easily removed once the process is completed,Irrelevant
A sheet of separating film between the acrylic and the model is also helpful in this regard,Relevant
The denturist then mixes the appropriate resin compounds in liquid form,Relevant
Upon drying the resin hardens to a durable finish,Relevant
This resin mixture is packed into the mold while a vertical vise packs it tightly,Relevant
At this point the model can be inspected to ensure it is filled properly and if necessary additional resin can be added,Relevant
Instead of vice packing certain types of acrylic may be poured into the mold,Irrelevant
This method is more prone to air bubbles than hand packing,Irrelevant
Once the mold is packed to the denturist s satisfaction it is heated to initiate the chemical reaction which causes the resin to harden,Relevant
This part of the process may take up to eight hours,Irrelevant
After the heating is done and the mold has cooled the mold is broken apart so the denture may be removed,Relevant
The denture is then put in the model of the patient s mouth to ensure that it fits and that the bite is good,Relevant
Because of the number of processing steps there may be a slight discrepancy in the fit,Irrelevant
Usually just a minor grinding and smoothing of surfaces is all that is necessary to make the denture fit correctly,Irrelevant
At this point if the denture is the removable type it is ready for use,Relevant
Implants require additional preparatory steps before they can be used,Relevant
The denturist must drill the appropriate holes in the jaw bone and attach an anchor,Relevant
After three to six months when the hole has healed and the anchor is set in place a small second surgical procedure is necessary to expose the implant and connect a metal rod to it that will be used to hold the crown or bridge,Relevant
Finally the replacement tooth is attached to the rod where it is held firmly in place,Relevant
The absorbent pad is formed on a movable conveyer belt that passes through a long forming chamber,Relevant
At various points in the chamber pressurized nozzles spray either polymer particles or fibrous material onto the conveyor surface,Relevant
The bottom of the conveyor is perforated and as the pad material is sprayed onto the belt a vacuum is applied from below so that the fibers are pulled down to form a flat pad,Relevant
At least two methods have been employed to incorporate absorbent polymers into the pad,Irrelevant
In one method the polymer is injected into the same feed stock that supplies the fibers,Relevant
This method produces a pad that has absorbent polymer dispersed evenly throughout its entire length width and thickness,Relevant
The problems associated with method are that loss of absorbent may occur because the fine particles are pulled through the perforations in the conveyor by the vacuum,Relevant
It is therefore expensive and messy,Irrelevant
This method also causes the pad to absorb unevenly since absorbent is lost from only one side and not the other,Relevant
A second method of applying polymer and fiber involves application of the absorbent material onto the top surface of the pad after it has been formed,Relevant
This method produces a pad which has absorbent material concentrated on its top side and does not have much absorbency throughout the pad,Irrelevant
Another disadvantage is that a pad made in Disposable Diaperthis way may lose some of the polymer applied to its surface,Irrelevant
Furthermore this approach tends to cause gel blocking since all the absorbent is on the outside of the pad,Irrelevant
The moisture gets trapped in this outer layer and does not have a chance to diffuse to the center,Relevant
This blockage holds moisture against the skin and can lead to discomfort for the wearer,Irrelevant
These problems are solved by controlling the mixture polymer and fibrous material,Relevant
Multiple spray dispensers are used to apply several layers of polymer and fiber,Relevant
As the fiber is drawn into the chamber and the bottom of the pad is formed a portion of the polymer is added to the mix to form a layer of combined polymer and fiber,Irrelevant
Then more pure fiber is pulled on top to give a sandwich effect,Relevant
This formation creates a pad with the absorbent polymer confined to its center surrounded by fibrous material,Relevant
Gel blockage is not a problem because the polymer is concentrated at core of pad,Irrelevant
It also solves the problem of particle loss since all the absorbent is surrounded by fibrous material,Relevant
Finally this process is more cost effective because it distributes the polymer just where it is needed,Irrelevant
After the pad has received a full dose of fiber and polymer it proceeds down the conveyor path to a leveling roller near the outlet of the forming chamber,Relevant
This roller removes a portion of the fiber at the top of the pad to make it a uniform thickness,Relevant
The pad then moves by the conveyor through the outlet for subsequent operations to form the competed diaper,Relevant
Sheets of nonwoven fabric are formed from plastic resin using the meltblown process as described above,Relevant
These sheets are produced as a wide roll known as a web which is then cut to the appropriate width for use in diapers,Relevant
There is a web for the top sheet and another for the bottom sheet,Relevant
It should be noted that this step does not necessarily occur in sequence after pad formation because the nonwoven fabrics are often made in a separate location,Irrelevant
When the manufacturer is ready to initiate diaper production these large bolts of fabric are connected to special roller equipment that feeds fabric to the assembly line,Irrelevant
At some point in the process stretched elastic bands are attached to the backing sheet with adhesive,Relevant
After the diaper is assembled these elastic bands contract and gather the diaper together to ensure a snug fit and limit leakage,Relevant
At this point in the process there are still three separate components the absorbent pad the top sheet and the backing sheet,Relevant
These three components are in long strips and must be joined together and cut into diaper sized units,Relevant
This is accomplished by feeding the absorbent pad onto a conveyor with the polyethylene bottom sheet,Relevant
The polypropylene top sheet is then fed into place and the compiled sheets are joined by gluing heating or ultrasonic welding,Relevant
The assembled diaper may have other attachments such as strips of tape or Velcro  which act as closures,Relevant
The long roll is then cut into individual diapers folded and packaged for shipping,Relevant
The components of an EKG machine are typically manufactured separately and then assembled prior to packaging,Irrelevant
These components including the electrodes the amplifier and the output device can be supplied by outside manufacturers or made in house,Relevant
The most common electrode used for an EKG machine is the silver and silver chloride electrode because the electrode potential of these electrodes is stable when exposed to biological tissue,Relevant
The electrodes are received from outside suppliers and checked to see if they conform to set specifications,Relevant
The type of electrode used depends on the EKG model,Irrelevant
Often multiple types of electrodes will be supplied with one EKG machine,Relevant
Each electrode contains a shielded cable that can be attached to the primary unit,Irrelevant
The electronic components of an EKG device are quite sophisticated and use the latest in electronic processing technology,Irrelevant
The amplifier and output device are assembled much like that of other electronic equipment,Relevant
It begins with a board that has the electronic configuration mapped out,Relevant
This board is then passed through a series of machines which place the appropriate chips diodes capacitors and other electronic pieces in the appropriate places,Relevant
When completed it is sent to the next step for soldering,Relevant
The electronic components are affixed to the board by a wave soldering machine,Relevant
Boards that enter this machine are first washed to remove any contaminants,Relevant
The board is then heated using infrared heat,Relevant
The underside of the board is passed over a wave of molten solder which fills in the appropriate spots through capillary action,Relevant
As the board is allowed to cool the solder hardens holding the pieces in place,Relevant
Depending on the type of display device manufacture method differs,Irrelevant
Certain devices such as magnetic tape recorders and paper printers can be supplied by outside manufacturers,Irrelevant
Other components like computer microprocessors can be designed and made right along with the primary internal electronics,Irrelevant
The components of the EKG machine are assembled and placed into an appropriate metal frame,Relevant
The finished devices are then put into final packaging along with accessories such as spare electrodes printout paper and manuals,Relevant
They are then sent out to distributors and finally to customers,Relevant
The first stage of escalator construction is to establish the design as described above,Irrelevant
The escalator manufacturer uses this information to construct the appropriately customized equipment,Relevant
There are two types of companies that supply escalators primary manufacturers who actually build the equipment and secondary suppliers that design and install the equipment,Irrelevant
In most cases the secondary suppliers obtain the necessary equipment from the primary manufacturers and make necessary modifications for installation,Irrelevant
Therefore most escalators are actually assembled at the primary manufacturer,Irrelevant
The tracks step chains stair assembly and motorized gears and pulleys are all bolted into place on the truss before shipping,Relevant
Prior to installation the landing areas must be prepared to connect to the escalator,Relevant
For example concrete fittings must be poured and the steel framework that will hold the truss in place must be attached,Irrelevant
After the escalator is delivered the entire assembly is uncrated and jockeyed into position between the top and bottom landing holes,Relevant
There are a variety of methods for lifting the truss assembly into place one of which is a scissors lift apparatus mounted on a wheeled support platform,Relevant
The scissors lift is outfitted with a locator assembly to aid in vertical and angular alignment of the escalator,Relevant
With such a device the upper end of the truss can be easily aligned with and then supported by a support wall associated with the upper landing,Relevant
The lower end of the truss can be subsequently lowered into a pit associated with the floor of the lower landing,Relevant
In some cases the railings may be shipped separately from the rest of the equipment,Irrelevant
In such a situation they are carefully coiled and packed for shipping,Relevant
They are then connected to the appropriate chains after the escalator is installed,Relevant
Make final connections for the power source and check to ensure all tracks and chains are properly aligned,Relevant
Verify all motorized elements are functioning properly that the belts and chains move smoothly and at the correct speed and that the emergency braking system is activated,Relevant
The step treads must be far enough apart that they do not pinch or rub against each other,Relevant
However they should be positioned such that no large gaps are present which could increase the chance of injury,Relevant
An escalator is a continuously moving staircase,Irrelevant
Each stair has a pair of wheels on each side one at the front of the step and one at the rear,Relevant
The wheels run on two rails,Relevant
At the top and bottom of the escalator the inner rail dips beneath the outer rail so that the bottom of the stair flattens making it easier for riders to get on and off,Relevant
The production of a fake fur can be a mostly automated process,Irrelevant
The manufacturing steps involved include production of the synthetic fibers construction of the garment and modification of the garment,Irrelevant
Making a fake fur begins with the production of the synthetic fibers,Relevant
While different types of polymers are used modacrylic polymers provide a good illustration of the fiber manufacturing process,Irrelevant
First the acrylonitrile and vinyl chloride monomers are mixed together in a large stainless steel container,Relevant
They are forced into a chamber in which the pressure and temperature is increased,Relevant
Mixing blades are constantly in motion and the polymerization process begins,Relevant
A white powdery resin is produced which is then converted into a thick liquid by dissolving it in acetone,Relevant
The liquid polymer mixture is then pumped through a filter to remove undissolved particles,Relevant
From the filter the material is pumped through spinnerets which are submerged in a water bath,Relevant
The spinnerets look similar to shower heads and when the polymer is extruded through it emerges as a group of continuous fibers called a tow,Relevant
The tow is then pulled along a conveyor belt and stretched through a series of pulleys,Relevant
As the tow is stretched it is also washed and dried,Relevant
As it dries the acetone is driven off leaving only the polymer,Relevant
The continuous fibers are then annealed making them stronger and are sent to a machine that cuts them to appropriate sizes,Relevant
After various quality control checks are performed on the fibers they are moved to the next phase of processing,Relevant
Here the polymers are soaked in dye solutions and colored,Relevant
While this is not the only phase of manufacture in which the fibers are colored this is usually the point where solid background colors are obtained,Irrelevant
While the fibers provide the primary texture and look for imitation fur the backing provides most of the structure,Irrelevant
Working off a specific garment design the backing which is made out of cotton or wool is sent through a machine to be appropriately cut,Relevant
It is then transferred to the next phase of production in which the fibers will be attached,Relevant
To convert the fibers into a garment four different techniques can be employed,Irrelevant
The most basic method is the weaving process,Irrelevant
In this process the fibers are looped through and interlaced with the backing fabric,Relevant
While this technique is fairly slow it can produce a large range of cloth shapes,Irrelevant
Another method of fake fur production is called tufting,Irrelevant
It is similar to weaving however it produces garments at a much higher rate of speed,Irrelevant
Circular loop knitting and sliver knitting are other methods of fake fur garment production,Irrelevant
Sliver knitting utilizes the same equipment used in jersey knitting,Irrelevant
This makes it the fastest and most economical of all the fake fur garment production techniques and it is also the one most used by manufacturers,Irrelevant
To simulate a natural fur the garments are treated in various ways,Irrelevant
First to ensure that the fake fur will remain unchanged after it is produced the fabric is heated,Relevant
This heat setting process preshrinks the fabric giving it improved stability and expanded fiber diameters,Relevant
Next to remove loose fibers from the fabric wire brushes are passed through the fabric,Relevant
This process is known as tigering,Irrelevant
Rough shearing of the fibers by cutting them with a set of helical knives gives Fake Furthem a uniform length,Relevant
The luster of the fabric can be improved through a method known as electrofying,Irrelevant
This is a polishing technique that involves combing the fabric with a heated grooved cylinder in both directions,Irrelevant
The next treatment is the application of chemicals such as resins and silicones which improves the feel and look of the fiber,Irrelevant
Coloring to simulate specific animals can also be enhanced at this staged,Relevant
Another round of electrofying can be done as well as a finishing shearing to remove any remaining loose fibers,Relevant
Depending on the type of fake fur embossing to simulate curls can also be done during this stage of manufacture,Irrelevant
After the fake fur has been produced the government requires that they are labeled as imitation fur fabrics,Relevant
These labels are typically sewn in the inside of the garment and must be legible throughout the life of the product,Irrelevant
In the final steps of fake fur manufacturing the garment is put in the appropriate packaging and shipped to distributors,Relevant
Fully integrated factories have been designed to produce compound fertilizers,Irrelevant
Depending on the actual composition of the end product the production process will differ from manufacturer to manufacturer,Irrelevant
Ammonia is one nitrogen fertilizer component that can be synthesized from in expensive raw materials,Irrelevant
Since nitrogen makes up a significant portion of the earth s atmosphere a process was developed to produce ammonia from air,Irrelevant
In this process Fertilizernatural gas and steam are pumped into a large vessel,Relevant
Next air is pumped into the system and oxygen is removed by the burning of natural gas and steam,Relevant
This leaves primarily nitrogen hydrogen and carbon dioxide,Irrelevant
The carbon dioxide is removed and ammonia is produced by introducing an electric current into the system,Relevant
Catalysts such as magnetite Fe 3 O 4 have been used to improve the speed and efficiency of ammonia synthesis,Relevant
Any impurities are removed from the ammonia and it is stored in tanks until it is further processed,Relevant
While ammonia itself is sometimes used as a fertilizer it is often converted to other substances for ease of handling,Irrelevant
Nitric acid is produced by first mixing ammonia and air in a tank,Relevant
In the presence of a catalyst a reaction occurs which converts the ammonia to nitric oxide,Relevant
The nitric oxide is further reacted in the presence of water to produce nitric acid,Relevant
Nitric acid and ammonia are used to make ammonium nitrate,Relevant
This material is a good fertilizer component because it has a high concentration of nitrogen,Irrelevant
The two materials are mixed together in a tank and a neutralization reaction occurs producing ammonium nitrate,Relevant
This material can then be stored until it is ready to be granulated and blended with the other fertilizer components,Relevant
To isolate phosphorus from phosphate rock it is treated with sulfuric acid producing phosphoric acid,Relevant
Some of this material is reacted further with sulfuric acid and nitric acid to produce a triple superphosphate an excellent source of phosphorous in solid form,Relevant
Some of the phosphoric acid is also reacted with ammonia in a separate tank,Relevant
This reaction results in ammonium phosphate another good primary fertilizer,Irrelevant
Potassium chloride is typically supplied to fertilizer manufacturers in bulk,Relevant
The manufacturer converts it into a more usable form by granulating it,Relevant
This makes it easier to mix with other fertilizer components in the next step,Irrelevant
To produce fertilizer in the most usable form each of the different compounds ammonium nitrate potassium chloride ammonium phosphate and triple superphosphate are granulated and blended together,Relevant
One method of granulation involves putting the solid materials into a rotating drum which has an inclined axis,Relevant
As the drum rotates pieces of the solid fertilizer take on small spherical shapes,Relevant
They are passed through a screen that separates out adequately sized particles,Relevant
A coating of inert dust is then applied to the particles keeping each one discrete and inhibiting moisture retention,Relevant
Finally the particles are dried completing the granulation process,Relevant
The different types of particles are blended together in appropriate proportions to produce a composite fertilizer,Relevant
The blending is done in a large mixing drum that rotates a specific number of turns to produce the best mixture possible,Relevant
After mixing the fertilizer is emptied onto a conveyor belt which transports it to the bagging machine,Relevant
Fertilizers are typically supplied to farmers in large bags,Relevant
To fill these bags the fertilizer is first delivered into a large hopper,Relevant
An appropriate amount is released from the hopper into a bag that is held open by a clamping device,Relevant
The bag is on a vibrating surface which allows better packing,Relevant
When filling is complete the bag is transported upright to a machine that seals it closed,Relevant
The bag is then conveyored to a palletizer which stacks multiple bags readying them for shipment to distributors and eventually to farmers,Relevant
Advanced technology and processing have improved the quality of fiberboard,Irrelevant
These include innovations in wood preparation resin recipes press technology and panel sanding techniques,Irrelevant
Advanced press technology has shortened overall pressing cycles while anti static technology has also contributed to increased belt life during the sanding process,Irrelevant
Producing quality fiberboard begins with the selection and refinement of the raw materials most of which are recycled from shavings and chips reclaimed from sawmills and plywood plants,Relevant
The raw material is first removed of any metal impurities using a magnet,Relevant
Next the material is separated into large chunks and small flakes,Relevant
Flakes are separated into sawdust and wood chip piles,Relevant
The material is sent through a magnetic detector again with the rejected material being separated for reuse as fuel,Relevant
Good material is collected and sent into a presteaming bin,Relevant
In the bin steam is injected to heat and soften the material,Relevant
The fibers are fed first into a side screw feeder and then into a plug screw feeder which compresses the fibers and removes water,Relevant
The compressed material is then fed into a refiner which tears the material into usable fibers,Relevant
Sometimes the fiber may undergo a second refining step in order to improve fiber purity,Irrelevant
Larger motors on the refiners are sometimes used to sift out foreign objects from the process,Irrelevant
Resin is added before the refining step to control the formaldehyde tolerances in the mixture and after refining a catalyst is added,Relevant
The fibers are then blown into a flash tube dryer which is heated by either oil or gas,Relevant
The ratio of solid resin to fiber is carefully controlled by weighing each ingredient,Relevant
Next the fiber is pushed through scalping rolls to produce a mat of uniform thickness,Relevant
This mat goes through several pressing steps to produce a more usable size and then is trimmed to the desired width before the final pressing step,Relevant
A continuous press equipped with a large drum compresses the mat at a uniform rate by monitoring the mat height,Relevant
Presses are equipped with electronic controls to provide accurate density and strength,Irrelevant
The resulting board is cut to the appropriate length using saws before cooling,Relevant
Presses have counterbalanced simultaneous closing systems that use hydraulic cylinders to effect platen leveling which when operating in conjunction with a four point position control gives greater individual panel thickness control,Irrelevant
The hydraulics system can close the press at speeds and pressures that reduce board precure problems while shortening overall pressing cycles,Relevant
To achieve a smooth finish the panels are sanded using belts coated with abrasives,Relevant
Silicon carbide has typically been used but with the requirement for finer surfaces other ceramic abrasives are utilized including zirconia alumina and aluminum oxide,Irrelevant
Eighthead sanding equipment and double sided grading improves surface smoothness consistency,Irrelevant
Anti static technology is used to remove the static electricity that contributes to rapid loading and excessive sanding dust thereby increasing belt life,Irrelevant
Panels can undergo a variety of finishing steps depending on the final product,Relevant
A wide variety of lacquer colors can be applied as well as various wood grain patterns,Relevant
Guillotine cutting is used to cut the fiberboard into large sheets for example 100 inches wide ,Relevant
For smaller sheet sizes such as 42 by 49 in 107 by 125 cm die cutting is used,Relevant
Specialty machines are used for cutting fiberboard into narrow strips of 1 24 in 2 5 61 cm widths,Relevant
Laminating machines are used to apply vinyl foil and other materials to the surface,Relevant
This process involves unwinding a roll of fiberboard material sending it between two rolls where the adhesive is applied combining the adhesive coated fiberboard with the laminating material between another set of rolls and sending the combined materials into the laminator,Irrelevant
Raw coffee beans are processed in two primary ways,Irrelevant
The dry method allows the beans to dry on the plant or be dehydrated by the sun after harvesting,Relevant
The beans are then separated from the rest of the plant debris by milling,Relevant
In the wet method the beans are steeped and fermented up to 24 hours then a water spray removes the pulp and the beans are dried in the sun or in tumble dryers,Relevant
A hulling machine then removes the protective membrane around the bean,Relevant
In both cases the beans are cleaned sorted and graded,Relevant
Roasting develops the beans natural flavor by making the raw beans darker and bringing out the oils,Irrelevant
Green raw beans are roasted in ovens at a temperature between 380 480 F 193 249 C for one to 17 minutes,Relevant
The degree of roasting determines the depth of flavorthe darker the roast Flavored Coffee Beanthe heavier the flavor,Irrelevant
There are five commons roasts American Viennese Italian French Dark and Espresso Black,Irrelevant
The American or Regular roast has light to medium brown beans with no oil on the bean,Relevant
It makes mild to medium coffee with a definite acidic snap,Irrelevant
The Viennese roast is slightly darker than American roast,Relevant
The Italian also known as Continental roast features dark brown beans with an oily surface,Relevant
It makes coffee that is dark flavored and bittersweet,Irrelevant
French Dark roasting produces dark brown almost black beans with a shiny oily surface,Relevant
With its smoky roasty flavors it makes an authoritative coffee,Irrelevant
Espresso Black is the highest roasting degree,Irrelevant
This roast produces beans which are almost carbonized and it yields the strongest brew,Irrelevant
If flavoring is added to beans which have too mild a roast the coffee lacks significant flavor characteristics and a flat tasting beverage results,Irrelevant
If the roast is too dark the added flavor is overshadowed by the taste of the beans,Relevant
For example a French Vanilla flavor will be lost on a French Roast bean because the robust quality of the bean will overwhelm the sweet creamy tones of the flavor,Irrelevant
The perfect roast color for flavored coffee is medium to brown,Irrelevant
After the beans are roasted they must be quickly cooled before flavorings can be added,Relevant
Flavoring the beans while they are still at high temperatures can destroy some of the flavor compounds,Irrelevant
In large commercial operations cooling is done by water quenching which is a quick economical process that has the undesirable effect of leaching out some of the natural flavor of the beans,Relevant
Gourmet beans are dried more carefully usually by jets of warm air,Relevant
The appropriate amount of flavoring to be used must be determined before flavor oils can be added to the roasted beans,Irrelevant
The rate of use typically varies between 2 3% Flavored Coffee Beanaveraging 2 7% industrywide,Irrelevant
A 3% usage rate means that three pounds of flavor oil are added to 100 pounds of roasted beans,Irrelevant
The amount of flavoring required depends primarily on the type of flavor and its intensity as well as the type of bean used and its roast level,Irrelevant
Cost constraints also may play a role in determining how much flavoring to apply to the beans because flavors are relatively expensive,Irrelevant
The combination of flavors to be used and the quantity to be applied to the beans is established by experimental trial and error in which test batches of beans are flavored with small quantities of oil until the desired characteristics are obtained,Irrelevant
This formulation process is similar to the way one decides how much sugar to put in a cup of coffee or teaadd a small amount taste it and if necessary add a little more,Irrelevant
Once the precise amount is set the dosage is held constant for that particular flavor oil and roasted bean combination,Irrelevant
For different combinations of oils and beans the usage level must be readjusted for optimal results,Irrelevant
Flavors are typically added to roasted beans before they are ground,Relevant
The beans are placed in a large mixer which is specially designed to gently tumble the beans without causing them damage,Relevant
Examples of this type of mixer include ribbon blenders drum rotators and candy pan coaters,Irrelevant
The flavors are usually introduced via a pressurized spray mechanism which breaks the oils into tiny droplets which allows for better mixing,Relevant
Oils must be added to the beans very gradually to guard against areas of highly concentrated flavor called hot spots,Relevant
The beans are agitated for a set amount of time to ensure the flavor is evenly spread,Relevant
This process may take 15 30 minutes depending on the batch size and mixing characteristics of the oil,Irrelevant
When the beans are properly coated they take on a glossy finish that indicates a uniform distribution of oils,Irrelevant
It is also important to note that instead of flavoring whole beans flavors in dry form can be blended with ground coffee,Irrelevant
In such cases the flavors are encapsulated in starch or some other powdered matrix,Irrelevant
There is enough moisture in the coffee to promote transfer of flavor and color from the encapsulated flavors to the coffee grounds in about 24 hours after mixing,Irrelevant
The finished product is packed in bags or cans as quickly as possible and sealed to prevent contact with the atmosphere,Relevant
Prior to packaging the container is flushed with nitrogen an inert gas a process that removes oxygen from the container,Relevant
Oxygen can react with components of the flavor oils and the beans and cause deterioration,Irrelevant
Coffee beans once roasted release their oils and begin to stale quickly when exposed to oxygen,Relevant
Briefly flushing the container with nitrogen before filling pushes all the oxygen out and ensures freshness,Relevant
Flavored beans should be stored in a cool dark place if they are to be used within three or four weeks,Relevant
If longer storage is required the beans may be frozen,Relevant
Wheat is received at the flour mill and inspected,Relevant
Samples of wheat are taken for physical and chemical analysis,Relevant
The wheat is graded based on several factors the most important of which is the protein content,Relevant
The wheat is stored in silos with wheat of the same grade until needed for milling,Relevant
An illustration from The Young Millwright and Miller s Guide depicting the processes of an automated grain mill,Irrelevant
From the collections of Henry Ford Museum   Greenfield Village ,Irrelevant
Before wheat can be ground into flour it must be free of foreign matter,Irrelevant
This requires several different cleaning processes,Irrelevant
At each step of purification the wheat is inspected and purified again if necessary,Relevant
The first device used to purify wheat is known as a separator,Relevant
This machine passes the wheat over a series of metal screens,Relevant
The wheat and other small particles pass through the screen while large objects such as sticks and rocks are removed,Relevant
The wheat next passes through an aspirator,Relevant
This device works like a vacuum cleaner,Relevant
The aspirator sucks up foreign matter which is lighter than the wheat and removes it,Relevant
Other foreign objects are removed in various ways,Relevant
One device known as a disk separator moves the wheat over a series of disks with indentations that collect objects the size of a grain of wheat,Relevant
Smaller or larger objects pass over the disks and are removed,Relevant
Another device known as a spiral seed separator makes use of the fact that wheat grains are oval while most other plant seeds are round,Relevant
The wheat moves down a rapidly spinning cylinder,Relevant
The oval wheat grains tend to move toward the center of the cylinder while the round seeds tend to move to the sides of the cylinder where they are removed,Irrelevant
Other methods used to purify wheat include magnets to remove small pieces of metal scourers to scrape off dirt and hair and electronic color sorting machines to remove material which is not the same color as wheat,Relevant
The purified wheat is washed in warm water and placed in a centrifuge to be spun dry,Relevant
During this process any remaining foreign matter is washed away,Relevant
The moisture content of the wheat must now be controlled to allow the outer Flourlayer of bran to be removed efficiently during grinding,Relevant
This process is known as conditioning or tempering,Irrelevant
Several methods exist of controlling the amount of water present within each grain of wheat,Irrelevant
Usually this involves adding rather than removing moisture,Irrelevant
Cold conditioning involves soaking the wheat in cold water for one to three days,Relevant
Warm conditioning involves soaking the wheat in water at a temperature of 115 F 46 C for 60 90 minutes and letting it rest for one day,Relevant
Hot conditioning involves soaking the wheat in water at a temperature of 140 F 60 C for a short period of time,Relevant
This method is difficult to control and is rarely used,Irrelevant
Instead of water wheat may also be conditioned with steam at various temperatures and pressures for various amounts of time,Irrelevant
If conditioning results in too much moisture or if the wheat happens to be too moist after purification water can be removed by vacuum dryers,Irrelevant
Wheat of different grades and moistures is blended together to obtain a batch of wheat with the characteristics necessary to make the kind of flour being manufactured,Relevant
At this point the wheat may be processed in an Entoleter a trade name for a device with rapidly spinning disks which hurl the grains of wheat against small metal pins,Relevant
Those grains which crack are considered to be unsuitable for grinding and are removed,Relevant
The wheat moves between two large metal rollers known as breaker rolls,Relevant
These rollers are of two different sizes and move at different speeds,Irrelevant
They also contain spiral grooves which crack open the grains of wheat and begin to separate the interior of the wheat from the outer layer of bran,Relevant
The product of the breaker rolls passes through metal sieves to separate it into three categories,Relevant
The finest material resembles a coarse flour and is known as middlings or farina,Irrelevant
Larger pieces of the interior are known as semolina,Irrelevant
The third category consists of pieces of the interior which are still attached to the bran,Irrelevant
The middlings move to the middlings purifier and the other materials move to another pair of breaker rolls,Relevant
About four or five pairs of breaker rolls are needed to produce the necessary amount of middlings,Relevant
The middlings purifier moves the middlings over a vibrating screen,Relevant
Air is blown up through the screen to remove the lighter pieces of bran which are mixed with the middlings,Relevant
The middlings pass through the screen to be more finely ground,Relevant
Middlings are ground into flour by pairs of large smooth metal rollers,Relevant
Each time the flour is ground it passes through sieves to separate it into flours of different fineness,Relevant
These sieves are made of metal wire when the flour is coarse but are made of nylon or silk when the flour is fine,Relevant
By sifting separating and regrinding the flour several different grades of flour are produced at the same time,Irrelevant
These are combined as needed to produce the desired final products,Relevant
Small amounts of bleaching agents and oxidizing agents are usually added to the flour after milling,Relevant
Vitamins and minerals are added as required by law to produce enriched flour,Relevant
Leavening agents and salt are added to produce self rising flour,Relevant
The flour is matured for one or two months,Relevant
The flour is packed into cloth bags which hold 2 5 10 25 50 or 100 lb About 0 9 2 3 4 5 11 3 22 7 or 45 4 kg ,Relevant
For large scale consumers it may be packed in metal tote bins which hold 3000 lb 1361 kg truck bins which hold 45 000 lb 20 412 kg or railroad bins which hold 100 000 lb 45 360 kg ,Irrelevant
After special tanning processes the cowhide selected to be used for the football Footballis cut into a bend which is the best and strongest part of the hide,Relevant
The bend is then die cut into panels,Relevant
Using a hydraulically driven clicking machine an operator cuts four panels into the precise shape required at the same time,Relevant
Next each panel goes through a skiving machine in order to reduce it to a predetermined thickness and weight,Relevant
A synthetic lining is sewn to each panel,Relevant
The lining which is composed of three layers of cross laid fabric firmly cemented together prevents the panel from stretching or growing out of shape during use,Relevant
The lining and panel are sewn together using an industrial size and strength version of a home sewing machine,Relevant
A facing is then applied to those areas that will carry the lacing holes as well as the hole for the inflating needle,Relevant
The holes are then punched,Relevant
The four panels are sewn together by a hot wax lock stitch machine to ensure that the seams are especially durable,Relevant
Then the ball is turned right side out,Relevant
Next a two ply butyl rubber bladder is inserted the ball is laced and then it is inflated with a pressure of not less than 12 5 lb 6 kg but no more than 13 5 lb 6 1 kg ,Relevant
After inflation the ball is checked to ensure it conforms to all size and weight regulations,Relevant
The ball is ready for branding with the manufacturer s name and number,Relevant
A two ply butyl rubber bladder is inserted the ball is laced and then it is inflated with a pressure of not less than 12 5 lb 6 kg but no more than 13 5 lb 6 1 kg ,Relevant
After final inspections the balls are boxed and shipped to designated schools and ball clubs,Relevant
The helmet outer shell is constructed of a tough plastic called polycarbonate alloy,Irrelevant
The polycarbonate alloy arrives at the manufacturing plant in pellet formin boxes of thermoplastic pellets the size of bee bees,Irrelevant
The pellets are loaded into an injection molding machine melted and forced into a cavity the size of a football helmet,Relevant
It takes approximately one minute to mold one shell,Irrelevant
Shells come in small medium large and extra large sizes,Irrelevant
The shell then drops out of the machine,Relevant
Next a multi drill fixture drills 14 15 holes into the mold a process that takes approximately 12 15 seconds to complete,Relevant
Next protective air liners are produced,Relevant
Certain rotationally molded one piece liners are inflatable and are used in the helmet for obtaining proper fit and to aid in dispersing the energy imparted by an impact,Relevant
Other specifically engineered liners contain special foams and energy attenuating or elastic materials,Irrelevant
Like air these materials are designed to absorb kinetic energy of movement and slow or decrease the impact of a blow to the head,Irrelevant
The foam based liners are made in several piecesone is for the back neck and sides of the helmet and another is for the crown,Irrelevant
To produce the special foams required for the liner large sheets of foam are die cut to size,Relevant
Then the vinyl encasement is die cut to size,Relevant
A piece of vinyl is loaded into a vacuum former,Relevant
The pieces of the die cut foam are put into the vinyl and thermoformed to make an airtight seal,Relevant
Another layer of vinyl is placed on top of the thermoform and the process is repeated,Relevant
The jaw pads which are designed to fit below the earlobe are affixed,Relevant
Different sizes or thicknesses are available,Irrelevant
Materiols used for the production of football helmets have evolved from leather to horder leather to molded polycarbonate shells which are used today because of their strength and weight,Irrelevant
Materiols used for the production of football helmets have evolved from leather to horder leather to molded polycarbonate shells which are used today because of their strength and weight,Irrelevant
Face masks are then attached,Relevant
There are several different styles of face masks,Irrelevant
The face masks are made out of steel wire and coated with plastic,Irrelevant
There also are three different versions of plastic face masks,Irrelevant
The chin straps are then attached,Relevant
The helmets can be painted in any one of the standard finished colors,Relevant
There are over 50 standard colors to choose,Irrelevant
More often however the color finish is injection molded in at the time the shell is constructed,Relevant
Decorative pieces such as decals are generally not applied by the manufacturer but by the organization purchasing the helmets,Irrelevant
The NFL does their own decaling as well,Irrelevant
At the end of the assembly line each helmet is subjected to inspection to ensure that the workmanship standards have been met,Relevant
Only then would each helmet be placed in a poly bag and into a compartmented carton for shipment to the warehouse,Relevant
Each helmet has a serial number inside the shell and the corresponding serial number is affixed to the outside of the carton,Relevant
Garbage truck bodies are built in a fixed location within a plant rather than moving down an assembly line or moving from one work station to another,Irrelevant
Component parts are fabricated in a machine shop and are then welded or assembled into subassemblies,Relevant
The subassemblies are brought together and are welded or assembled into the finished body,Relevant
The body is then lifted and mounted on a truck chassis,Relevant
Here is a typical sequence of operations for the assembly of a front loader garbage truck ,Irrelevant
The pieces for the body floor sides top and front end are cut to size in a machine shop using band saws metal shears and cutting torches,Relevant
Some flat pieces are bent in press brakes or curved in roller benders,Relevant
Mounting holes are punched or drilled,Relevant
The pieces for each of the body componentsfloor sides top and frontare moved to separate sub assembly areas where they are welded together,Relevant
Welding the long reinforcing channels on the sides is often done on a flat welding table with an automatic welder that is programmed to make welds in the correct areas,Relevant
Other welding is done manually,Relevant
Templates are sometimes used to position the pieces correctly while clamps hold the pieces in position,Irrelevant
Each of the body subassemblies is brought to the body assembly area sometimes called a cell,Relevant
First the floor is brought in and positioned on supports to make it level and stable,Relevant
Then the sides are lifted in and are braced while they are welded to the floor,Relevant
Then the top is lowered and welded into place followed by the front,Relevant
When the body shell is finished it looks like an empty shoe box with one end missing,Relevant
While the body shell is being formed the operating parts of the body are being fabricated and welded into subassemblies,Relevant
These include the lift arms fork assembly hopper cover tailgate and packer blade,Irrelevant
They are formed in the same sequence as described in steps 1 and 2,Irrelevant
When the body shell is complete the operating subassemblies are brought to the body assembly area in sequence,Relevant
The packer blade is installed first because it goes inside the body,Relevant
It is lifted into position and the packer hydraulic cylinder is attached between the packer blade and the body shell,Relevant
Some body designs use two hydraulic cylinders for increased packing force,Relevant
The hopper cover is installed next,Relevant
It is welded over the loading opening on the forward portion of the body top,Relevant
The cover is hydraulically opened as the lift arms bring the trash container up and over the top and it includes shields to prevent the trash from spilling over the sides,Relevant
The hydraulic cylinder is attached to the mounting points,Relevant
The lift arms fork assembly and front and rear torque tubes are assembled and attached to the body shell,Relevant
The various hydraulic cylinders are attached to their mounting points,Relevant
The tailgate is installed last,Relevant
It is hung from its top mounted hinges and the hydraulic cylinders are attached to their mounting points,Relevant
The body lights are installed and the electrical wiring is routed and connected,Relevant
The hydraulic hoses are routed and connected to the various hydraulic cylinders,Relevant
At this point some manufacturers paint the body before it is mounted on the truck while others wait until the body is mounted on the truck before they paint it,Relevant
If the body is to be painted at this point the lights and the exposed portions of the hydraulic cylinder rods are masked off with paper and tape,Relevant
After the body is painted any name plates decorative striping and warning labels are applied as required,Relevant
A truck cab and chassis is delivered to the garbage truck body builder,Relevant
The most popular style is known as a low cab forward in which the cab sits slightly ahead of the engine,Irrelevant
Many of the components required to work with a particular kind of garbage body are available directly from the truck manufacturer,Irrelevant
Other components must be installed by the garbage body builder,Irrelevant
This work is done in a separate area of the plant,Irrelevant
It often includes mounting a hydraulic fluid tank and filters on the truck frame installing a hydraulic pump and power take off on the side of the transmission and mounting controls and instruments in the cab to operate the various hydraulic cylinders on the body,Relevant
When the body is completed and the truck cab and chassis have been properly modified the body is lifted and bolted to the truck frame rails,Relevant
The rear mounting brackets are usually bolted tight while the front mounting brackets are usually attached through springs which permit the frame rails to move slightly relative to the body,Relevant
This allows the truck frame to flex slightly when traveling over uneven ground at landfill sites,Relevant
If the rails were held rigidly against the body the resulting stress forces could cause the frame rails to break,Irrelevant
The electrical wires and hydraulic hoses are connected between the truck and the body,Relevant
The hydraulic tank and lines are filled with hydraulic fluid,Relevant
As a final test all the lights are checked and the hydraulic cylinders are actuated through their full cycle,Relevant
The truck is then driven outside to await delivery to the customer,Relevant
The design of the mask itself varies by the industrial application,Irrelevant
Some masks are designed with speech diaphragms some are built to accept extra filters and others are made to be connected to an extenal air supply,Irrelevant
Although the fundamental design does not vary for a given type of mask the kind of filtrant used will vary depending on the product s intended use,Irrelevant
Manufacturers stock a variety of mask styles and cartridge filtrants,Irrelevant
When they receive orders for a specific type of mask they can custom design a mask that has the appropriate features,Irrelevant
The canister is made from styrene plastic which is resistant to water and other Gas Maskchemicals has good dimensional stability and is specially designed for injection molding,Irrelevant
Injection molding is a process by which molten plastic is injected into a mold under high pressure,Relevant
The mold used for gas mask canisters consists of two disk shaped pieces of metal that are clamped together,Relevant
The plastic resin is liquefied by heating and then injected into the mold via an injection plunger,Relevant
The mold is then subjected to high pressure,Relevant
Most injection machines compress the mold with a pressure ranging from 50 2 500 tons 51 2 540 metric tons ,Relevant
After the molten plastic has been compressed cooling water is forced through channels in the mold to cool and harden the plastic,Relevant
The pressure is released the two halves of the mold are separated and the finished canister is ejected,Relevant
Styrene is a thermoplastic resin which means it can be repeatedly remelted so the scrap pieces can be reworked to make additional canisters,Relevant
Therefore there is very little wasted plastic in this process,Irrelevant
A similar molding process is conducted to create small circular screens that fit inside the canister,Relevant
The screens are designed to hold the activated carbon in place inside the cartridge,Relevant
As the canisters travel down the assembly line one screen is inserted the canister is filled with the appropriate filtrant then the second screen is put into place,Relevant
The face piece is injection molded from silicone rubber,Relevant
Silicone rubber has outstanding stability is resistant to high temperatures and can conform to curves in the face and head,Relevant
It is also thermoplastic and can remolded as necessary,Irrelevant
The molding process is very similar to the one described above,Irrelevant
After molding the skirt must be removed from the mold and any rough edges must be cleaned off by hand before the other components can be attached,Relevant
The pieces are assembled on a partially automated assembly line with two to four line workers supervising the process,Irrelevant
The completed filter canister is attached to the face piece and the eyepieces are inserted and held in place with adhesive,Relevant
Finally the straps and bands are attached to the face piece with metal rivets,Relevant
When assembly is complete the mask is given a final quality check,Relevant
When the masks pass inspection they are identified with the appropriate markings in accordance with the American National Standard for Identification of Air Purifying Respirator Cartridges and Canisters,Relevant
The finished masks are packaged for shipping,Relevant
The containers used to package the masks must also designate the identity of the mask,Relevant
Furthermore they must be designed for easy access if the masks might be used in the event of an emergency,Irrelevant
Three piece golf balls are more difficult to make and can require more than 80 different manufacturing steps and 32 inspections taking up to 30 days to make one ball,Irrelevant
Two piece balls require about half of these steps and can be produced in as little as one day,Irrelevant
The center of the two piece ball is a molded core,Irrelevant
It is a blend of several different ingredients all of which are chemically reactive to give a rubber type compound,Irrelevant
After heat and pressure is applied a core of about 1 5 inches 3 75 cm is formed,Relevant
Injection molding or compression molding is used to form the cover and dimples on a two piece ball using a two piece mold,Relevant
In injection molding the core is centered within a mold cavity by pins and molten thermoplastic is injected into the dimpled cavity surrounding the core,Relevant
Heat and pressure cause the cover material to flow to join with the center forming the dimpled shape and size of the finished ball,Relevant
As the plastic cools and hardens the pins are retracted and the finished balls are removed,Relevant
With compression molding the cover is first injection molded into two hollow hemispheres,Relevant
These are positioned around the core heated and then pressed together using a mold which fuses the cover to the core and also forms the dimples,Relevant
Three piece balls are all compression molded since the hot plastic flowing through would distort and probably cause breaks in the rubber threads,Relevant
Flash or rough spots and the seam on the molded cover are removed,Relevant
Two coats of paint are applied to the ball,Relevant
Each ball sits on two posts which spins so that the paint is applied uniformly,Relevant
Spray guns that are automatically controlled are used to apply the paint,Relevant
Next the ball is stamped with the logo,Relevant
The final step is the application of a clear coat for high sheen and scuff resistance,Relevant
Drying and packaging 5 After the paint is applied the balls are loaded into containers and placed in large dryers,Relevant
After drying the balls are ready for packaging in boxes and other containers,Relevant
Graham crackers are made through a series of steps which convert the raw ingredients Graham Crackerinto finished products,Irrelevant
Important steps include ingredient handling compounding forming or machining baking post conditioning and packaging,Irrelevant
Most of the major ingredients like flour vegetable shortening and sugar are delivered to cracker manufacturers in large quantities and stored in bulk tanks,Irrelevant
Depending on the ingredient these tanks may be fashioned with special equipment to control their internal environments,Irrelevant
For example a liquid such as vegetable shortening must be stored at a specific temperature until it is ready to be used,Irrelevant
If the temperature varies too much the shortening could be difficult to pump or could adversely affect the dough,Irrelevant
Therefore this tank has controls which can maintain the appropriate temperature,Irrelevant
Other tanks may have refrigeration capabilities,Irrelevant
At the start of cracker production ingredients are transferred to mixing tanks,Relevant
Liquid bulk ingredients are transferred using metered pumps which can move a specific quantity of material,Irrelevant
Bulk solid materials are pumped via a method called pneumatic transfer which involves fluidizing the powders with a stream of air and then pumping them with metered pumps,Relevant
Minor ingredients that are supplied in boxes bags and drums are weighed and poured into the mixing tank by hand,Relevant
The graham cracker ingredients are mixed together in specific quantities as specified in the recipe,Relevant
Cracker doughs are mixed with either vertical spindle mixers or high speed horizontal drum mixers,Irrelevant
The order that ingredients are added to the mixture is important,Irrelevant
Typically the process begins with sugar water and shortening,Relevant
This forms a mixture with a cream like consistency,Irrelevant
Next the remaining ingredients are added and a short dough is obtained,Relevant
This dough is allowed to set for two to three hours for the leavening agents to work,Relevant
Graham crackers are usually sold in two forms as squares or as animal crackers,Irrelevant
The dough used for both is ostensibly the same,Relevant
In the machining process the dough is delivered from a hopper onto a conveyor belt and rolled thin by a series of metal gauging rolls,Relevant
The thickness of the sheet is reduced by each of these rollers,Relevant
Some manufacturers stack multiple sheets on top of each other in a process known as laminating,Relevant
They are rolled out further allowed to relax and then sent along a conveyor belt to the cutting machines,Relevant
The edges of the dough sheets are cut smooth by rotary cutting machines and excess dough is sent back to the hopper for reuse,Relevant
When animal crackers are made the sheet of dough is cut into the various animal shapes by cutting machines called stampers,Relevant
These stampers or rotary dies have the animal shapes fashioned on them with intricate details,Relevant
After this stage sugar cinnamon or honey are applied to the top of the dough if the recipe requires it,Relevant
The crackers are baked in a tunnel oven,Relevant
The dough is first transferred to a metal conveyor belt and then moved through the oven which can be 100 300 feet 30 90 m long,Relevant
Baking takes place in three stages called development drying and coloring,Relevant
In the development stage the dough sets taking on the size and shape of the final product,Relevant
The greatest amount of water is lost in the drying stage,Relevant
In the coloring stage the dough is changed from pale white to a light golden brown,Relevant
The amount of time a product spends baking is controlled by the speed of the moving conveyor belt,Relevant
Animal crackers bake for as little as four minutes,Relevant
Graham crackers bake slightly longer,Relevant
After the crackers come out of the oven they travel on a series of conveyors to cool,Relevant
At some point in this process they are flipped over and then flipped back to ensure that cooling is throughout,Relevant
The total cooling time can be twice as long as the baking time,Relevant
Depending on the recipe other coatings can be put on the crackers after they have cooled,Relevant
These include such things as icings chocolate coatings or sugar,Irrelevant
These can be applied using either stenciling extruders or depositors,Irrelevant
Excess toppings are removed using forced air and vibrating shaker devices,Relevant
The final step in the manufacturing process is packaging,Relevant
Because of the fragile nature of some crackers the packaging must be rigid and airtight,Relevant
For square graham crackers the crackers are cut and stacked individually and wrapped in flexible films,Relevant
Animal crackers which are less fragile are typically packaged in a coated bag,Relevant
Both types of crackers are then put inside boxes which are appropriately decorated to make the product appealing,Relevant
These boxes are put into larger case boxes which can be stacked on pallets and shipped to stores,Relevant
Gummy manufacturing uses a starch molding process,Irrelevant
First the candy is made then it is filled into starched lined trays,Relevant
The filled trays are then cooled overmight and the resulting formed candy is emptied from the trays,Relevant
In the mass production of gummy candy significant improvements have been made to increase the speed and efficiency of this process,Irrelevant
The manufacture of gummy candy begins with compounding,Relevant
Factory workers known as compounders follow instructions outlined in the recipes and physically pour the appropriate amount of gummy raw materials into the main mixing tanks,Relevant
These tanks which are equipped with mixing heating and cooling capabilities are quite large,Irrelevant
Depending on the size of the batch gummy candy compounding can take from one to three hours,Irrelevant
When the batch is complete it is sent to the Quality Control QC laboratory to make sure that it meets the required specifications,Relevant
After the gummy candy is compounded and passes QC testing it is either pumped or transferred to a starch molding machine known as a Mogul,Relevant
This machine can automatically perform the multiple tasks involved in making gummy candy,Irrelevant
It is called a starch molding machine because starch is a main component,Irrelevant
In this machine starch has three primary purposes,Irrelevant
First it prevents the candy from sticking to the candy molds which allows for easy removal and handling,Relevant
Second it holds the gummy candy in place during the drying cooling and setting processes,Relevant
Finally it absorbs moisture from the candies giving them the proper texture,Relevant
Making gummy candy in a Mogul is a continuous process,Irrelevant
At the start of the machine trays that contain previously filled cooled and formed gummy candy are stacked,Relevant
The trays are then removed from the stack one by one and iwove along a conveyor belt into the next section of the machine known as the starch buck,Relevant
As they enter the starch buck the trays are inverted and the gummy candy falls out into a vibrating metal screen known as a sieve,Relevant
The vibrating action of the sieve in concert with oscillating brushes removes all of the excess starch that adheres to the gummy candy,Relevant
These pieces then move along a conveyor belt to trays where they are manually transferred to other machines by which they can be decorated further and placed into appropriate packaging,Relevant
A more recent advance called the pneumatic starch buck further automates this step,Irrelevant
In this device a tightly fitting cover is placed over the filled trays,Relevant
When it is inverted the candies adhere to the cover and remain in their ordered position,Irrelevant
The excess starch is then removed by fast rotating compressed air jets,Relevant
The candy can then be conveyed for further processing,Irrelevant
Gummy candy is manufactured in a machine called a Mogul,Irrelevant
Cooled trays of gummy candy are inverted in the starch buck,Relevant
This candy is ready for packaging,Relevant
The trays are then filled with starch to keep the candy from sticking and sent to the printer table which imprints a pattern into the starch,Relevant
The depositor fills the trays with the hot candy mixture and the trays are sent back to the stacker to cool for 24 hours,Relevant
Then the machine can start the process again,Relevant
The starch that is removed from the gummy candy is reused in the process but first it must be cleaned dried and otherwise reconditioned,Relevant
Candy particles are first removed by passing the starch through a metal screen known as a sieve,Relevant
It is then conveyed to a recirculating starch conditioning system,Relevant
As it enters this machine it is dried by being passed through hot moving air,Relevant
After drying the starch is cooled by cool air jets and conveyed back out to the Mogul to be reused in the starch molding process,Relevant
The starch returns from the drier via a conveyor belt to the Mogul where it is filled into the empty trays and leveled,Relevant
These were the same trays that were inverted and emptied in step two,Irrelevant
These starch filled trays then move to a printer table,Relevant
Here a board that has the inverse of the mold printed on it presses the starch down so the mold has an indent in it,Relevant
From here the trays are moved to the depositors,Relevant
The gummy candy compounded in step 1 is transferred to the depositors,Relevant
This is the part of the mogul that has a filling nozzle and can deliver the exact amount of candy needed into the trays as they pass under it,Relevant
The depositor section of the mogul can contain 30 or more depositors depending on how many imprints there are on the trays,Relevant
In more modern depositors the color flavor and acids can be added to the gummy base right in the depositor,Relevant
This allows different colors and flavors to be made simultaneously speeding up the process,Relevant
The filled trays are moved along to a stacking machine and then sent to a cooling room where they stay until they are appropriately cooled and formed,Relevant
This part of the process can take over 24 hours,Relevant
After this happens the trays are moved back to the Mogul and the process starts all over again,Relevant
Before a batch of hair dye is made the ingredients must be certified,Irrelevant
That is the chemicals must be tested to make sure they are what they are labeled and that they are the proper potency,Irrelevant
Certification may be done by the manufacturer in house,Irrelevant
In many cases the ingredients arrive from a reputable distributor who has provided a Certificate of Analysis and this satisfies the manufacturer s requirements,Relevant
Next a worker weighs out the ingredients for the batch,Relevant
For some ingredients only a small amount is necessary in the batch,Irrelevant
But if a very large batch is being made and several ingredients are needed in large amounts these may be piped in from storage tanks,Relevant
In some hair dye formulas the dye chemicals are pre mixed in hot water,Irrelevant
The dye chemicals are dumped in a tank and water which has been already heated to 158 F 70 C is pumped in,Relevant
Other ingredients or solvents may also be added to the pre mix,Relevant
The pre mix is agitated for approximately 20 minutes,Relevant
The pre mix is then added to a larger tank containing the other ingredients of the hair dye,Relevant
In a small batch the tanks used may hold about 1 600 lbs 725 kg and they are portable,Irrelevant
A worker wheels the pre mix tank to the second mix tank and pours the ingredients in,Relevant
For a very large batch the tanks may hold 10 times as much as the portable tanks and in this case they are connected by pipes,Relevant
In a formula in which no pre mixing is required after checking and weighing the in gredients go directly to the mixing step,Relevant
The ingredients are simply mixed in the tank until the proper consistency is reached,Relevant
If a heated pre mix is used the second mix solution must be allowed to cool,Relevant
The ingredients that follow the pre mix may be additional solvents surfactants and alkalizers,Irrelevant
If the formula includes alcohol it is no added until the mix reaches 104 F 40 C so that it does not evaporate,Relevant
Fragrances too are often added at the end of the mix,Relevant
The finished batch of hair dye is then piped or delivered to a tank in the filling area,Relevant
A nozzle from this tank lets a measured amount of hair dye into bottles moving beneath it on a belt,Relevant
The filled bottles continue on the belt to machines which affix labels and cap them,Relevant
From the filling area the bottles are taken to the packaging line,Relevant
At the packaging line the hair dye bottle is put in a box together with any other elements such as a bottle of developer or special finishing shampoo instruction sheet and gloves and cap or any other tools provided for the consumer,Relevant
After the package is complete it is put in a shipping carton,Relevant
The full cartons are then taken to the warehouse to await distribution,Relevant
While the individual parts are produced by machinery the assembly is done by hand,Irrelevant
Wooden combs are cut from a block of wood,Relevant
Channels are carved out in descending lengths across the comb,Relevant
Plastic combs are injection molded,Relevant
The plastic compound is heated to a semi fluid state and then mechanically injected into a mold,Relevant
The compound hardens quickly the mold is popped open and the new comb is expelled,Relevant
The reed plate is stamped and machined creating slits that correspond to the channels on the comb,Relevant
Reeds are cut and tapered by machine,Relevant
One end of each reed is riveted to the reed plate so that a reed lays over each slit,Relevant
The opposite end of the reed is left free,Relevant
The reed plate is manually tuned,Relevant
The tuner strikes the appropriate tuning fork and then files each reed to the correct tone,Relevant
Filing the base end lowers the pitch filing the free end raises the pitch,Relevant
The reed plate is attached to the comb with nails or screws,Relevant
The assembly is done manually at a workbench similar to that used by a shoemaker,Irrelevant
The nails are inserted into the holes with needle nosed pliers and then tapped in gently with a small hammer,Relevant
The plate cover which has been machined shaped and stamped with the company name and harmonica type is attached to the reed comb assembly with screws or nails,Relevant
The harmonicas are inserted into boxes and packed for shipment to retailers,Relevant
Boards of spruce maple beech and other woods are received by the harpmaker and inspected,Relevant
In order to perfectly match the grain of harp with a natural finish boards of wood all from the same tree may be received together,Relevant
The boards are then stored for about six months to become adjusted to the local climate in order to avoid any future problems with splitting or cracking,Relevant
Power woodcutting machines cut the boards into rough approximations of the pieces needed,Relevant
More detailed shaping of these pieces is done with hand held woodcutting tools,Irrelevant
Harpmakers learn their craft in a series of apprenticeships,Irrelevant
New workers build the base of the harp then go on to learn the skills needed to build the body and the soundboard,Irrelevant
Only the most experienced harpmakers work on the column and the neck,Irrelevant
Many thin layers of wood are glued together under pressure to foim wooden parts which are stronger than solid wood,Relevant
The various wooden parts are then stored to await assembly,Relevant
Metalworkers use a wide variety of power and hand held tools to shape brass and steel into the nearly 1 500 pieces needed to make up the action of the harp,Relevant
Some simple parts may be purchased from outside manufacturers,Relevant
The metal components are then stored to await assembly,Irrelevant
Before assembly the wooden components are decorated as desired,Relevant
The column may be hand carved with complex designs which take several weeks to complete,Relevant
All wooden parts are sanded smooth in preparation for finishing,Relevant
They are then sprayed with clear lacquer or colored wood stain,Relevant
After one coat of lacquer or stain is applied it is allowed to dry and then sanded smooth again,Relevant
This process is repeated up to 10 times over as long as two weeks,Relevant
The soundboard may then be painted with elaborate designs,Relevant
A modern concert harp stands about 70 75 in 1 442 04 9 m high is about 40 in 1 m wide weighs about 70 90 lb 32 41 kg and has 47 strings ranging in size from a few inches to several feet in length,Irrelevant
Some harps have gilded columns and bases,Irrelevant
The gilder begins by sanding unfinished wooden parts to remove all imperfections,Relevant
Layers of gesso a special mixture of glues are applied to the smooth wood,Relevant
After the gesso sets layers of clay are applied and sanded smooth,Relevant
Glue is applied to a small area of the smooth clay,Relevant
Gold leaf 0 000004 inches thick 0 1 microns is applied with a brush,Relevant
The gold is so thin that it cannot be handled directly by human hands ,Irrelevant
The process is repeated on other small areas until an entire component is gilded,Relevant
Excess gold is wiped away and another layer of gold leaf is applied,Relevant
Some portions of the gold are burnished to a brilliant sheen by rubbing them with a tool made of polished agate,Relevant
Clear lacquer is applied to protect the gold,Relevant
Master harpmakers begin the slow painstaking process of bringing the wood and metal components together to form the harp,Relevant
The parts of the neck body soundboard base and column are brought together to form the frame,Relevant
The complex mechanism of the action is fitted within the column and connected to the disks on the brass plate below the neck and the pedals on the base,Relevant
Strings are attached to brass pegs on the neck fed through the disks and attached to the centerstrip of the soundboard,Relevant
At first the strings are very loose,Irrelevant
They are slowly tightened to the correct level of tension and tuned to the correct pitch,Relevant
After a final inspection the harp is packed in close fitting foam within a cardboard box to be shipped to the purchaser,Relevant
The harp manufacturer also makes special protective wooden cases with wheels which allow the harp to be moved with relative ease,Relevant
The pump is usually procured as a finished unit and installed into the system by integrating it with coupling and piping components,Irrelevant
Designed for the specific size and fluid requirements of the system the pump may be shipped depending upon its size directly to the installation site,Irrelevant
This usually occurs with large commercial heat pumps supplying heat and or refrigeration to office buildings,Irrelevant
Smaller residential models may have the pump installed into an assembly that includes the condenser evaporator and various piping,Irrelevant
These units encased in a sheet metal box will be comprised of various subassemblies for the condenser and evaporator in order to bolt every component to the box or to one another,Irrelevant
Some of the brackets used will form the base of the unit where the pump will be bolted down to a metal pan and connected to an AC motor,Relevant
Assembled from several different sheets of metal encasement units are sheared to size in a shear press,Relevant
After they are cut to the proper dimensions small assembly holes are punched in the metal using a Computer Numerically Controlled CNC punch press,Relevant
These punch presses have either a moveable table to move the sheet metal or a moveable die which is able to punch holes in different spots of the metal,Relevant
Punch presses are often directed where to punch by a computer aided design CAD program,Relevant
Different shaped punching tools are stored within the machine providing it with the ability to punch all of the necessary holes by simply changing the computer program,Irrelevant
After punching the sheet will move to a Numerically Controlled NC press brake where it will be bent in different shapes and configurations,Relevant
The press brake bends the metal into many different shapes by using dies or tooling,Relevant
Unlike the CNC punch press the press brake will require a manual change in tooling to perform a different bend,Irrelevant
The sheet is then ready to be welded riveted or bolted to the other sheets and brackets,Irrelevant
Once assembled these sheets provide most of the stability of stand alone units,Relevant
The condenser and evaporator are made of many small thin copper or aluminum tubes which are bent around curved dies by tube bending machines,Relevant
NC tube bending machines will be programmed to provide the same exact bend on each of the tubes allowing them to be stacked one on top of the other,Relevant
These tubes will then be attached to plates or fins through which the tubes will pass and be joined through tube expansion or joint welding,Relevant
This creates a tightly sealed system,Relevant
The tube and plate assembly will act as a heat exchanger by allowing the working fluid to pass through the system inside the tubes while giving off the heat in the condenser to another fluid medium passing between the plates and acquiring the heat given off through the tubes,Relevant
In order to provide strength or connectivity to the components small brackets are punched out of mild carbon steel,Relevant
The brackets are usually punched out of steel coil that is continuously fed first through a decoiler,Relevant
Once it is decoiled it is sheared bent and formed in one continuous process,Relevant
Heat PumpThis is done with a progressive die configuration where the bracket remains attached to the coil as it moves from station to station,Relevant
Each station adds something to the bracket either a hole or notch and sends it to the next station until finally it is sheared from the coil,Relevant
This process may be outsourced to vendors who specialize in progressive die or transfer press operations and can provide better cost control,Relevant
More tubing is fabricated and bent to provide the rest of the piping needed to connect the pump with the condenser and evaporator,Relevant
Various fittings and connection components are utilized,Irrelevant
The expansion valve which is contained within some of the piping lines is another component purchased as a whole unit,Irrelevant
The expansion valve is a designed fitting that provides for the expansion of the working fluid and connection of smaller diameter tubing with larger diameter tubing,Irrelevant
In small residential units the valve is contained within the main box while in larger commercial units it may be installed on site in the piping system,Irrelevant
Components subassemblies brackets and or plates are painted or powder coated for corrosion resistance,Relevant
Before painting however some parts are treated with a special solvent to remove any grease or oil left from the manufacturing operations,Relevant
This is usually done by submersing the parts in large tanks filled with solvent and then drying them in a special oven,Relevant
Some parts which are specially coated with zinc nickel or chrome will be fed through an acid bath before being dipped into tanks of coating solution,Relevant
Once cleaned the parts are manually loaded onto trays or hung on specially designed racks and fed into a paint booth,Relevant
The paint is applied with a pressurized paint dispenser that will spray paint into each crevice,Relevant
After passing vigorous inspections the heat pump is sent to packaging where the system will be boxed and shipped to the installation site,Relevant
Generally heat pumps will be installed at the construction site,Relevant
The compressor and evaporator will be constructed of massive 3 in 7 5 cm diameter tubing and have larger chambers where the working fluid will change phases,Relevant
The pump itself will be bolted to a concrete pad and connected Heat Pumpwith a large DC motor or natural gas generator,Relevant
The fittings and valves will be shipped and installed into the piping system while supported by brackets and braces anchored to existing walls,Relevant
These installations exhibit significant engineering challenges and often require cooperation between the contractor and heat pump manufacturer,Relevant
Heavy duty trucks are assembled from component parts,Irrelevant
Each truck manufacturer usually builds its own cabs and a few also build their own engines transmissions axles and other major components,Irrelevant
In most cases however the major components and many of the other components are built by other companies and are shipped to the truck assembly plant,Irrelevant
In most plants the trucks move along an assembly line as components are added by different groups of workers at successive workstations,Irrelevant

A computer tells the machine the size and location of the required holes along the length of the frame rails,Relevant
Small threaded studs are spot welded inside the C section of the frame rails,Relevant
The air lines for the brakes and the electrical wires for the lights and sensors are placed inside the frame rails and are secured with rubber cushioned clamps fastened to the studs,Relevant
The brackets for the frame crossmembers are bolted in place using high strength bolts or self clinching fasteners,Relevant
The left and right frame rails are then positioned opposite each other and the cross members are added,Relevant
The frame now resembles a long ladder with the rails as the sides and the crossmembers as the rungs,Relevant
Other frame mounted componentssuch as engine mounts suspension brackets and air tanksare bolted in place,Relevant
The front and rear axles are fitted with the proper hubs the round ends to which the wheels are attached brakes and brake drums,Relevant
The axles are clamped to the suspensions by means of long u bolts,Relevant
Some suspensions use long leaf springs while others use inflated rubber air bags,Irrelevant
The front and rear axles and suspensions are lifted into place and attached to the suspension brackets on the frame,Relevant
The shock absorbers are attached between the axles and the frame,Relevant
Up until this point the frame assembly is usually moved from station to station either manually or with overhead hoists,Irrelevant
The frame is now placed on a moveable support and begins moving down the assembly line,Relevant
The air tanks and brake chambers are connected to the air lines and the lights and sensors are connected to the proper wires,Relevant
If the vehicle is to be a tractor the fifth wheel is lifted onto the frame and bolted into place,Relevant
From this point on the frame assembly with the axles suspensions and frame mounted components is referred to as the chassis,Relevant
All components that are not to be painted are covered with masking tape or paper,Relevant
The chassis then moves into a paint booth where it is painted with compressed air spray guns,Relevant
Most truck manufacturers require that all component parts be received with a primer coat of paint so priming is not necessary,Relevant
After the chassis has been thoroughly painted and visually checked it moves into a drying oven where a flow of hot air dries the paint,Relevant
As it emerges from the oven the masking tape and paper are removed,Relevant
The engine and transmission are brought into the plant alongside the assembly line,Relevant
Almost all trucks now use diesel engines,Irrelevant
The clutch is installed and the transmission is bolted onto the rear of the engine,Relevant

The radiator assembly is bolted onto its brackets ahead of the engine,Relevant
The fuel lines air hoses starter cables and coolant hoses are connected to the engine,Relevant
The fuel tanks are secured to their frame brackets and connected to the fuel lines,Relevant
Batteries are secured in the battery box but are not connected to prevent accidental sparking,Relevant
The tires are mounted on the wheels at a workstation adjacent to the assembly Heavy Duty Truckline,Relevant
Aluminum wheels are left natural or may be polished,Relevant
Steel wheels are painted before the tires are mounted,Relevant
The tires and wheels are mounted on the axle hubs and the lug nuts are tightened,Relevant
At this point the truck is taken off its moveable supports and sits on its own tires,Relevant
[Steps 15 23 are performed in a separate area off the assembly line] 15 The cab and sleeper substructures are welded or fastened together in jigs to hold the pieces in place,Relevant
The substructures give the cab and sleeper their strength and provides fastening points for the outer skin and the inner upholstery and trim,Relevant
The outer skin pieces are welded or fastened in place,Relevant
This includes the sides back floor and roof pieces,Relevant
The joints between pieces are overlapped and sealed to prevent leaks,Relevant
The cab and sleeper doors are secured to the hinges,Relevant
The hood is usually a molded plastic piece and is shipped to the plant without any hardware attached,Relevant
The hood is checked for rough surfaces and is sanded as required,Relevant
The cab hood and sleeper for each truck are painted at the same time,Relevant
The surfaces are cleaned and the areas that are not to be painted are masked off with paper or tape,Relevant
If a paint design such as a different color stripe is specified the stripe area is painted first then the stripe is masked off and the main body color is applied on a second pass through the paint booth,Relevant
After each pass the cab hood and sleeper go through a drying oven,Relevant
After the final pass the masking is removed and the paint is visually inspected,Relevant
The truck starts with a frame assembly that acts as the backbone of the truck and finishes with the completed fully operational vehicle being driven off the end of the assembly line under its own power,Relevant
The grille headlight brackets hood hinges and latches and the manufacturer s emblem or name are installed on the hood,Relevant
The finished hood is then stored alongside the assembly line,Relevant
The exterior components of the cab and sleeperthe grab handles mirrors visors etcare mounted before any work on the interior begins,Relevant
The instrument panel is attached to the dashboard,Relevant
The gauges warning lights and switches are installed and hooked up to the appropriate wires and hoses,Relevant
The entire dashboard assembly is then installed in the cab along with the cab heater system and steering column,Relevant
Pads of foam insulation are placed in the cab and sleeper walls and the interior upholstery pieces are secured in place on the walls and ceiling,Relevant
Plastic trim pieces are screwed in place to cover exposed edges and seams,Relevant
The floor is covered with a rubber mat or fabric carpet laminated to a sound absorbing pad and the edges are secured,Relevant
The seats are installed on top of the floor covering and secured with bolts into the main cab structure,Relevant
The windshield and rear windows are carefully pressed into place,Relevant
A rubber gasket seals the edges between the glass and the cab structure,Relevant

The transmission shift lever is installed through the floorboard and the clutch pedal is attached to the clutch linkage,Relevant
After all the cab connections are made the hood is lowered onto the chassis and secured to its pivot point,Relevant
The bumper is attached to brackets on the frame,Relevant
Wire connections are made for the headlights and front turn signals,Relevant
The engine radiator and other reservoirs are filled and the air conditioning system is charged,Relevant
A small amount of diesel fuel is added to the tanks to allow a short road test,Relevant
The steering wheel which had been left out to give working room in the cab is now installed and the batteries are connected,Relevant
The completed truck is then driven off the end of the assembly line,Relevant
To make sure that the front and rear axles are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the centerline of the frame the truck is placed on a laser alignment machine and the axle positions are adjusted as required,Relevant
The angle of the wheels is also adjusted,Relevant
This ensures that the truck will handle properly and have satisfactory tire life,Relevant
The truck is driven onto a dynamometer and secured with chains,Relevant
The rear wheels of the truck sit on rollers set into the ground and connected to the dynamometer,Relevant
As the truck engine spins the rear wheels on the rollers the dynamometer measures the engine power to ensure it is operating correctly,Relevant
The truck is driven slowly through a water spray booth as the driver checks for cab leaks,Relevant
The driver then takes the truck out for a short drive to check out the overall operation,Relevant
If the truck passes all the tests it is parked on ready row to be delivered to the dealer,Relevant
Various manuals are available that explain to amateur holographers how to make holograms at home,Irrelevant
The following steps describe the commercial mass production of a holographic image of an actual three dimensional object,Irrelevant
A laser is used to illuminate the physical object with the reflected light falling on the photoresist plate,Relevant
Simultaneously a reference beam from the laser also falls directly on the photoresist plate,Relevant
The interference patterns of these two light beams react with the photo sensitive coating to record a holographic image of the object,Relevant
Common exposure times are between one to 60 seconds,Irrelevant
In photography slight motion of the object or the film results in a blurred image,Irrelevant
In holography however the exposed plate will be blank contain no image at all if during the exposure there is movement as small as one fourth the wavelength of the laser light wavelengths of visible light range from 400 to 700 billionths of a meter ,Irrelevant
A typical photoresist plate has a 6 in 15 24 cm square working area an extra half inch 1 25 cm of space on two edges allows the plate to be clamped into position,Irrelevant
Because many holograms are smaller than this several different images can be ganged clustered onto one plate just as numerous individual photographs are exposed on one roll of film,Irrelevant
The plate on which the original hologram is recorded is called the master,Irrelevant
After being exposed the master is processed in a chemical bath using standard photographic developers,Relevant
Before proceeding with production the master is inspected to confirm that the image has been properly recorded,Relevant
Because of the chemical reactions caused by the laser and the developer on the photoresist the developed plate s surface resembles the surface of a phonograph record there are about 15 000 grooves per inch 600 per cm reaching a depth of about 0 3 microns 1 micron is a thousandth of a millimeter ,Irrelevant
The master is mounted into a jig frame and sprayed with silver paint to achieve good electrical conductivity,Relevant
The jig is lowered into a tank along with a supply of nickel,Relevant
An electric current is introduced and the master is electroplated with nickel,Relevant
The jig is removed from the tank and washed with Hologramdeionized water,Relevant
The thin nickel coating which is called the metal master shim is peeled off the master plate,Relevant
It contains a negative image of the master hologram the negative is actually a mirror image of the original hologram ,Irrelevant
Using similar processes several generations of shims are created,Relevant
Those made from the metal master shim are known as grandmothers and they contain positive images of the original hologram,Irrelevant
At this stage numerous copies of the original image are combined duplicated in rows on one shim that can be used to print multiple copies with a single impression,Relevant
Successive generations of shims are known as mothers daughters and stamper shims,Irrelevant
Because these generations alternate between negative and positive images of the original the stamper shims are negative images that will be used during actual production runs to print the final product holograms 4 Stamper shims are mounted in embossing machines A roll of polyester film or a similar material that has been smoothed with an acrylic coating is run through the machine Under intense heat and pressure the shim presses the holographic image onto the film to a depth of 25 millionths of a millimeter The embossed film is rewound onto a roll 5 The roll of embossed film is loaded into a chamber from which the air is removed to create a vacuum The chamber also contains aluminum wire which is vaporized by heating it to 2 000 F 1 093 C The sheet is exposed to the vaporized aluminum as it is rewound onto another roll and in the process it becomes coated with aluminum After being removed from the vacuum chamber the film is treated to restore moisture lost under the hot vacuum condition A top coating of lacquer is applied to the film to create a surface that can be imprinted with ink The roll of film which may be as wide as 92 in 2 3 m is sliced into narrower rolls 6 Depending on what type of film was used and what kind of product is being made one or more finishing steps may be done For instance the film may be laminated to paper board to give it strength The film is also cut into shapes desired for the final product and may be printed with messages Heat sensitive or pressure sensitive adhesive is applied to the back of holograms that will be affixed to other objects or used as stickers 7 The holograms are either attached to other products or are counted and packaged for shipment ,Irrelevant
Envelope construction basically involves the sewing of the gores together,Irrelevant
Whether done by hand or industrial sewing machine there are three stitches,Irrelevant
The double lap seam features two rows of parallel stitching along the folded over fabric seam,Irrelevant
Preferred by manufacturers for its strength and lightness the seam features about eight stitches in every inch 3 per cm ,Irrelevant
A few manufactures use a flat seam straight parallel stitching holds two pieces of fabric together and the zigzag zigzag parallel stitching with a double lap of fabric ,Irrelevant
The load tapes and cords are also sewn in,Relevant
After the envelope is stitched it is coated,Relevant
The coating is applied mechanically and under pressure,Relevant
Finally if the envelope is to be used for advertising purposes an applique is attached with a slogan or name,Relevant
It can be applied with acrylic spray paint or ready made adhesive letters or banners can be attached,Irrelevant
If the artwork is large it can be sewn into the envelope proper by being cut directly into the gores,Irrelevant
This can be a complex demanding process,Irrelevant
Baskets are manufactured base first,Relevant
On top of the plywood base with runners a frame of cane is built up to 1 in 2 5 cm in diameter,Irrelevant
At the corner the frame surrounds stainless steel wires and load frames,Relevant
Around the frame the rattan or willow is woven,Relevant
Holes are left in the body of the basket for cylinder straps,Relevant
The finished basket is coated with varnish to help maintain its shape and set the cane together,Relevant
Finally the edges are protected with sewn in rawhide leather or suede,Relevant
The instrument dashboard is built in as are the propane tanks for the burner unit,Irrelevant
Many balloon manufacturers outsource these components and assemble them between the basket and the envelope after the other parts are put together,Irrelevant
Although ice cream is available in a variety of forms including novelty items such as chocolate dipped bars and sandwiches the following description applies to ice cream that is packaged in pint and half gallon containers,Irrelevant
The milk arrives at the ice cream plant in refrigerated tanker trucks from local dairy farms,Relevant
The milk is then pumped into 5 000 gal 18 925 1 storage silos that are kept at 36 F 2 C ,Relevant
Pipes bring the milk in pre measured amounts to 1 000 gal 3 7851 stainless steel blenders,Relevant
Premeasured amounts of eggs sugar and additives are blended with the milk for six to eight minutes,Relevant
The blended mixture is piped to the pasteurization machine which is composed Ice Creamof a series of thin stainless steel plates,Relevant
Hot water approximately 182 F 83 C flows on one side of the plates,Irrelevant
The cold milk mixture is piped through on the other side,Relevant
The water warms the mixture to a temperature of 180 F 82 C effectively killing any existing bacteria,Relevant
By the application of intensive air pressure sometimes as much as 2 000 pounds per square inch 141 kg per sq cm the hot mixture is forced through a small opening into the homogenizer,Relevant
This breaks down the fat particles and prevents them from separating from the rest of the mixture,Irrelevant
In the homogenizer which is essentially a high pressure piston pump the mixture is further blended as it is drawn into the pump cylinder on the down stroke and then forced back out on the upstroke,Relevant
The mixture is piped back to the pasteurizer where cold water approximately 34 F 1 C flows on one side of the plates as the mixture passes on the opposite side,Relevant
In this manner the mixture is cooled to 36 F 2 C ,Relevant
Then the mixture is pumped to 5 000 gal 18 925 1 tanks in a room set at 36 F 2 C where it sits for four to eight hours to allow the ingredients to blend,Relevant
The ice cream is pumped to stainless steel vats each holding up to 300 gal 1 136 1 of mixture,Relevant
Flavorings are piped into the vats and blended thoroughly,Relevant
Now the mixture must be frozen,Relevant
It is pumped into continuous freezers that Ice Creamcan freeze up to 700 gal 2 650 1 per hour,Relevant
The temperature inside the freezers is kept at 40 F 40 C using liquid ammonia as a freezing agent,Relevant
While the ice cream is in the freezer air is injected into it,Relevant
When the mixture leaves the freezer it has the consistency of soft serve ice cream,Irrelevant
If chunks of food such as strawberry or cookie pieces are to be added to the ice cream the frozen mixture is pumped to a fruit feeder,Relevant
The chunks are loaded into a hopper at the top of the feeder,Relevant
Another smaller hopper fitted with a starwheel is located on the front of the feeder,Irrelevant
An auger on the bottom of the machine turns the hoppers so that the chunks drop onto the starwheel in pre measured amounts,Irrelevant
As the mixture passes through the feeder the starwheel pushes the food chunks into the ice cream,Relevant
The mixture then moves to a blender where the chunks are evenly distributed,Relevant
Automatic filling machines drop preprinted pint or half gallon sized cardboard cartons into holders,Relevant
The cartons are then filled with premeasured amounts of ice cream at the rate of 70 90 cartons per hour,Relevant
The machine then places a lid on each cartons and pushes it onto a conveyer belt,Relevant
The cartons move along the conveyer belt where they pass under a ink jet that spray paints an expiration date and production code onto each carton,Relevant
After the imprinting the cartons move through the bundler a heat tunnel that covers each cup with plastic shrink wrapping,Relevant
Before storage and shipping the ice cream must be hardened to a temperature of 10 F 23 C ,Relevant
The conveyer system moves the ice cream cartons to a tunnel set at 30 F 34 C ,Relevant
Constantly turning ceiling fans create a wind chill of 60 F 5 1 C ,Relevant
The cartons move slowly back and forth through the tunnel for two to three hours until the contents are rock solid,Relevant
The cartons are then stored in refrigerated warehouses until they are shipped to retail outlets,Relevant
The manufacture of imitation crab meat begins by preparing the fish that will be converted to surimi,Relevant
When the fish are caught in large nets they must be manually sorted by species and cleaned,Relevant
They are further Imitation Crab Meat mechanically sorted by size to optimize the yield of fillets,Relevant
Scales are mostly removed from the fish after sorting,Relevant
The fish are then conveyored to a filleting machine which removes the head tail and viscera,Relevant
Water washing is done next to remove excess fluids,Relevant
This whole process can be done either on the fishing boat or in land based manufacturing plants,Relevant
The prepared fish fillets can then be minced or mechanically deboned and made into surimi,Relevant
This is done using a mechanical deboner which removes the skin scales fins and bones,Relevant
This machine is made up of a thick rubber belt and a perforated drum,Relevant
As the fish passes through this machine the belt presses it against the drum forcing the soft flesh particles to the interior of the drum while leaving the harder scales and bones on the outside,Relevant
The drum is constantly rotated and the excess outer material is scraped off and collected in a waste bin,Relevant
The minced fish is next thoroughly washed with water in a process called leaching,Relevant
This is done in a large tank which is emptied and refilled with water repeatedly,Relevant
Leaching removes many undesirable water soluble materials such as fats inorganic salts and some proteins,Relevant
After the final leaching cycle the mince is partially dewatered before moving to the refining phase of manufacture,Irrelevant
Refining machines are made up of a cylindrical screen and a rotor,Irrelevant
The mince is selectively separated with the soft white meat in the front of the machine and the harder browner meat in the back,Relevant
This refining step removes any residual materials such as skin bones and scales,Relevant
The refined mince is sent to a screw press that removes all excess water,Relevant
After dewatering cryoprotective compounds such as sugar and sorbitol are added to the mince to help protect the fish proteins from breaking down during the final freezing stage of manufacture,Relevant
The Imitation Crab Meat final step in surimi production involves packing it in polyethylene bags in 22 pound 10 kg blocks and quickly freezing it to below 4 F 20 C ,Relevant
The surimi is stored at this temperature until it is ready to be used,Relevant
The frozen surimi is converted to imitation crab meat through various steps,Irrelevant
First it is warmed to about 25 F 4 C then sliced into coarse flakes,Relevant
In a process known as comminution the surimi flakes are then mixed together in a stone bowl grinder with other ingredients in the crab meat recipe,Relevant
These ingredients include starch salt natural crab meat egg white and flavors,Irrelevant
This mixture results in a thick surimi paste which is then transferred to a holding tank,Relevant
The paste is pumped from the holding tank to the sheet forming equipment,Relevant
Here continuous sheets of surimi about 10 inches 25 cm wide and 0 05 inch 1 2 mm thick are produced,Irrelevant
Due to the chemical nature of the surimi protein these sheets are very smooth,Relevant
After the sheets are formed they are sent to machines for the initial cooking,Relevant
This cooking helps set the sheets and prepares them for the slitting operation which gives the meat the appearance and texture of crab meat,Relevant
The slitting is done by a machine which is composed of two steel rollers that cut the surimi sheet into thin 0 1 inch 1 5 mm wide strands,Relevant
These thin strands are then bundled and rolled into a rope,Relevant
This rope is given the appropriate color wrapped and cut to the desired size,Relevant
It is then steamed cooked forming a product that looks and tastes very much like the crab meat it is designed to imitate,Relevant
Imitation crab meat is mechanically vacuum packed in thermoformed trays,Relevant
This protects the meat from contamination and provides an appealing look,Relevant
Some common plastics used for packing include polyethylene nylon and polyester,Irrelevant
After packing the imitation crab meat is typically pasteurized in a steam cooker,Relevant
This step helps prevent bacterial growth and increases shelf life,Irrelevant
The manufacture of instant coffee begins with brewing coffee in highly efficient extraction equipment,Relevant
Softened water is passed through a series of five to eight columns of ground coffee beans,Relevant
The water first passes through several hot cells 284 356 F or 140 180 C at least some of which operate at higher than atmospheric pressure for extraction of difficult components like carbohydrates,Relevant
It then passes through two or more cold cells about 212 F or 100 C for extraction of the more flavorful elements,Relevant
The extract is passed through a heat exchanger to cool it to about 40 F 5 C ,Relevant
By the end of this cycle the coffee extract contains 20 30% solids,Relevant
After a filtering step the brewed coffee is treated in one of several ways to increase its concentration,Relevant
The goal is to create an extract that is about 40% solids,Irrelevant
In some cases the liquid is processed in a centrifuge to separate out the lighter water from the heavier coffee extract,Relevant
Another technique is to remove water by evaporation before cooling the hot brewed extract,Relevant
A third alternative is to cool the extract enough to freeze water and then mechanically separate the ice crystals from the coffee concentrate,Irrelevant
Part of the enjoyment of making and drinking coffee is smelling the aroma,Irrelevant
During the several steps of the manufacturing process volatile aromatic elements are lost they must be returned in a later step to produce an attractive instant coffee product,Irrelevant
Aromatics can be recovered during several stages of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
For instance gases released during the roasting and or grinding processes can be collected,Relevant
Ground roasted coffee can be heated to release additional aromatic gases,Relevant
Passing steam or appropriate solvents through a bed of ground roasted coffee can strip and capture aromatic components,Relevant
Aromatic oils can be expressed from spent coffee grounds by exerting pressure of at least 2 000 lb per sq in 14 000 kPa ,Irrelevant
Gases can also be distilled from coffee extract after the brewing process is complete,Relevant
To preserve as much of the aroma and flavor as possible oxygen is removed from the coffee extract,Relevant
This is accomplished by foaming other gases such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen through the liquid before it enters the dehydration phase of the manufacturing process,Relevant
Two basic methods are available for converting the liquid coffee extract to a dry form,Irrelevant
Spray drying is done at a higher temperature which affects the taste of the final product but it is less costly than freeze drying,Relevant
Cooled clarified liquid concentrate is sprayed through a nozzle at the top of a drying tower,Relevant
The tower is at least 75 ft 23 m tall,Irrelevant
Air that has been heated to about 480 F 250 C is blown downward through the mist to evaporate the water,Relevant
The air is diverted out of the tower near the bottom and it is filtered to remove fine particles which can be recirculated back through the tower or reintroduced during the agglomeration step,Relevant
The dry coffee powder collects in the bottom of the tower before being discharged for further processing,Relevant
The resulting powder contains 2 4% moisture and consists of free flowing non dusty particles,Irrelevant
Spray drying may be followed by a step to form the powder into coarser particles that will dissolve more completely in the consumer s cup,Relevant
The agglomeration process Instant Coffeebasically involves rewetting the surfaces of the coffee powder particles and bringing the particles into contact so that they will adhere to each other and form larger more granular particles,Irrelevant
This is accomplished by exposing the powder to steam or a fine mist while tumbling it in the air,Irrelevant
Freeze drying may be used instead of spray drying,Irrelevant
The process involves four steps beginning with primary freezing,Irrelevant
Coffee extract is chilled to a slushy consistency at about 20 F 6 C ,Relevant
The prechilled slush is placed on a steel belt trays or drums and further cooled in a series of steps until it reaches a temperature of 40 50 F 40 [ 45] C ,Relevant
Quick cooling processes taking 30 120 seconds result in smaller lighter colored products while slower processes taking 10 180 minutes generate larger darker granules,Irrelevant
The slabs of ice are broken into pieces and ground into particles of the proper size for the drying step,Relevant
The particles are sieved to ensure proper sizing and those that are too small are melted and returned to the primary freezing stage,Relevant
The frozen particles are sent into a drying chamber where under proper conditions of heat and vacuum the ice vaporizes and is removed,Relevant
Volatile aromas that have been recovered from earlier steps in the manufacturing process are sprayed on the dry coffee particles,Relevant
This may be done during the packaging operation,Irrelevant
Instant coffee particles are hygroscopicthat is they absorb moisture from the air,Irrelevant
Consequently they must be packaged under low humidity conditions in a moisture proof container to keep the product dry until purchased and opened by the consumer,Irrelevant
Also to prevent loss of aroma and flavor the product is packaged in a low oxygen atmosphere usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen ,Relevant
The process of creating iron on decals involves three key steps preparation of the stencil to be used to print the image the screen printing process itself and transfer of the image to the fabric substrate,Irrelevant
The first step is to create a stencil of the image,Relevant
As described above stencils are Iron On DecalIron On Decalmade from paper or plastic sheets which are coated with a thin layer of lacquer or gelatin,Relevant
An outline of the image to be printed is cut into this thin layer and the lacquer or gelatin is peeled away,Relevant
A solvent is then used to adhere the stencil to the underside of the fabric screen,Relevant
Once the stencil has dried on the screen the paper or plastic backing sheet is removed leaving only the film layer,Relevant
The portions of the stencil that were cut away expose a section of the screen through which ink can be forced,Relevant
Such stencils may be produced from photographic images by a similar process but instead of cutting away the portions of the image a light sensitive material is used to mark an image on the screen,Relevant
Alternatively the stencil may be painted directly on the screen using tusche,Relevant
Image transfer is accomplished by forcing various inks which are placed on top of the screen fabric through the stencil and onto the printing substrate,Relevant
A rubber squeegee is used to force ink through openings in the stencil,Relevant
Ink application may be done by hand or by automated printing processes,Relevant
The different colors are laid down sequentially one at a time,Relevant
The plastisol type must be heated to cure after each application,Relevant
This curing is done at temperatures of 225 250 F 107 121 C ,Irrelevant
The ink must be heated to this temperature for about one minute and then cooled before the next color can be added,Relevant
The sublimation type requires no heat curing ,Irrelevant
It should also be noted that the colors are laid down in reverse order from last to first,Irrelevant
Therefore the finished decal resembles a multi layer sandwich,Irrelevant
The bottom layer is the release paper followed by what are called the detail colors,Irrelevant
Then the background colors are laid down one at a time,Irrelevant
Upon completion of the printing process the image is ready to be transferred to a T shirt or other garment,Relevant
Before transferring the image the fabric must be laid out on a smooth hard surface,Relevant
For a T shirt a piece of heavy cardboard is inserted between its front and back to provide firm support and prevent the transfer from sticking to the back of the garment,Relevant
Heat and pressure are then applied using an ordinary household iron or a special piece of equipment called a dry mounting press,Relevant
The latter consists of two flat electrically heated metal plates that provide even pressure and heat to the fabric,Relevant
Using the dry press allows for better image transfer with less chance of scorching,Relevant
For iron on decals made with plastisol inks the dry press is set to about 300 F 149 C ,Relevant
This temperature is adequate to melt the lacquer layer holding the inks,Irrelevant
Continued heat and pressure for one to three minutes cause the molten ink lacquer film to migrate to the fabric,Relevant
When the heat source is removed the ink lacquer combination cools and binds to the fabric,Relevant
After cooling is complete the paper backing is peeled away,Relevant
A similar process is used for sublimation inks except no carrier layer is needed because the pigments vaporize and transfer directly to the fabric as result of heat and pressure,Irrelevant
A temperature of 350 375 F 177 191 C is usually sufficient to affect this change,Irrelevant
Sublimation inks transfer more cleanly than the plastisol type since there is no lacquer coating or film to be transferred,Irrelevant
Growing and processing natural rubber is one of the most complex agricultural industries and requires several years,Irrelevant
It combines botany chemistry and sophisticated machinery with dexterous skills of the people who harvest the trees,Irrelevant
Contrast this with synthetic rubber production which involves chemical reactions and sophisticated chemical processing machinery that is automatically controlled by computers,Irrelevant
The production of natural latex is described below,Irrelevant
Seeds from high grade trees are planted and allowed to grow for about 12 to 18 months in the nursery before a new bud is grafted to the seedling,Relevant
After bud grafting the year old seedling tree is cut back and is ready for transplanting,Relevant
The bud sprouts shortly after transplanting resulting in a new tree with better properties,Relevant
Approximately 150 trees are planted per acre 375 per ha which are cultivated and cared for until they are ready for tapping in about six to seven years,Irrelevant
To harvest latex a worker shaves off a slanted strip of bark halfway around the tree and about one third in 0 84 cm deep,Relevant
Precise skill is required for if the tree is cut too deeply the tree will be irreparably damaged,Relevant
If the cut is too shallow the maximum amount of latex will not flow,Relevant
The latex then bleeds out of the severed vessels flows down along the cut until it reaches a spout and finally drops into a collection cup that will later be drained,Relevant
Tapping is repeated every other day by making thin shavings just below the previous cut,Relevant
When the last scar created by the cuts is about 1 ft 0 3 m above the ground the other side of the tree is tapped in similar fashion while the first side renews itself,Relevant
Each tapping takes about three hours and produces less than a cup of latex,Relevant
A tapper first collects the cut lump which is coagulated latex in the cup and tree lace which is latex coagulated along the old cut,Relevant
Next the tapper makes a new cut,Relevant
The latex first flows rapidly then declines to a steady rate for a few hours after which it slows again,Irrelevant
By the next day the flow has nearly stopped as the severed vessel becomes plugged by coagulated latex,Irrelevant
To prevent most of the liquid latex from coagulating before it can be conveniently pooled and transported the tapper adds a preservative such as ammonia or formaldehyde to the collection cup,Relevant
Both the liquid and coagulated latex is sent to factories for processing,Relevant
To increase tree yields and reduce tapping times chemical stimulants are used,Relevant
Puncture tapping in which the bark is quickly pierced with sharp needles is another method that can improve productivity since it enables the same worker to tap more trees per day,Relevant
About 10% of the latex is processed into a liquid concentrate by removing some of the water and increasing the rubber content to 60%,Irrelevant
This is achieved either by spinning the water out of the latex through centrifugal force by evaporation or by a method known as creaming,Relevant
In this method a chemical agent is added to the latex that causes the rubber particles to swell and rise to the liquid s surface,Relevant
The concentrate is shipped in liquid form to factories where it is used for coatings adhesives and other applications,Relevant
Other rubber and field latex is coagulated with acid,Relevant
A giant extrusion dryer that can produce up to 4 000 lbs 1 816 kg per hour removes the water creating a crumb like material,Irrelevant
The dried rubber is then compacted into bales and crated for shipment,Relevant
Ribbed smoked sheets are made by first diluting the latex and adding acid,Relevant
The acid makes rubber particles bunch together above the watery serum in which they are suspended,Relevant
After several hours roughly one pound 0 45 kg of soft gelatinous rubber coagulates for every three pounds 1 35 kg of latex,Irrelevant
The rubber is allowed to stand for one to 18 hours then the slabs are pressed into thin sheets through a system of rollers that wrings out excess liquid,Relevant
The final set of rollers leaves a ribbed pattern on the sheets that increases the surface area and hastens drying,Relevant
The sheets are dried for up to a week in smoke houses before being packed and shipped,Relevant
To make rubber products the mix is shaped by placing it in a heated mold which helps shape and vulcanize the material,Relevant
For more complex products such as tires a number of components are made some with fiber or steel cord reinforcement which are then joined together,Relevant
Surgical gloves are made by dipping a ceramic form into latex withdrawing the form and then drying the latex shape,Relevant
In the United States most trees destined to be cut into lumber are grown in managed forests either owned by the lumber company or leased from the government,Relevant
After the trees have reached an appropriate size they are cut down and transported to a lumber mill where they are cut into various sizes of lumber,Relevant
Here is a typical sequence of operations for processing trees into lumber,Irrelevant
Selected trees in an area are visually inspected and marked as being ready to be cut down or felled,Relevant
If a road does not already exist in the area one is cut and graded using bulldozers,Relevant
If operations are expected to extend into the rainy season the road may be graveled and culverts may be installed across streams to prevent washouts,Relevant
Most tree felling is done with gasoline powered chain saws,Relevant
Two cuts are made near the base one on each side to control the direction the tree will fall,Relevant
Once the tree is down the limbs are trimmed off with chain saws and the tree is cut into convenient lengths for transportation,Relevant
If the terrain is relatively level diesel powered tractors called skidders are used to drag the fallen tree sections to a cleared area for loading,Relevant
If the terrain is steep a self propelled yarder is used,Relevant
The yarder has a telescoping hydraulic tower that can be raised to a height of 110 ft 33 5 m ,Irrelevant
Guy wires support the tower and cables are run from the top of the tower down the steep slopes to retrieve the felled trees,Irrelevant
The tree sections or logs are then loaded on trucks using wheeled log loaders,Relevant
The trucks make their way down the graded road and onto public highways on their way to the lumber mill,Relevant
Once at the mill giant mobile unloaders grab the entire truck load in one bite and stack it in long piles known as log decks,Relevant
The decks are periodically sprayed with water to prevent the wood from drying out and shrinking,Relevant
Logs are picked up from the log deck with rubber tired loaders and are placed on a chain conveyor that brings them into the mill,Relevant
In some cases the outer bark of the log is removed either with sharp toothed grinding wheels or with a jet of high pressure water while the log is slowly rotated about its long axis,Irrelevant
The removed bark is pulverized and may be used as a fuel for the mill s furnaces or may be sold as a decorative garden mulch,Relevant
The logs are carried into the mill on the chain conveyor where they stop momentarily as a huge circular saw cuts them into predetermined lengths,Relevant
This process is called bucking and the saw is called a bucking saw,Irrelevant
If the log has a diameter larger than 2 3 ft 0 6 0 9 m it is tipped off the conveyor and clamped onto a moveable carriage that slides lengthwise on a set of rails,Relevant
The carriage can position the log transversely relative to the rails and can also rotate the log 90 or 180 degrees about its length,Irrelevant
Optical sensors scan the log and determine its diameter at each end its length and any visible defects,Relevant
Based on this information a computer then calculates a suggested cutting pattern to maximize the number of pieces of lumber obtainable from the log,Relevant
The headrig sawyer sits in an enclosed booth next to a large vertical bandsaw called the headrig saw,Relevant
He reviews the suggested cutting pattern displayed on a television monitor but relies more on his experience to make the series of cuts,Relevant
The log is fed lengthwise through the vertical bandsaw,Relevant
The first cut is made along the side closest to the operator and removes a piece of wood called a slab,Relevant
The outer surface of the slab has the curvature of the original tree trunk and this piece is usually discarded and ground to chips for use in paper pulp,Relevant
The carriage is returned to its original position and the log is shifted sideways Depending on the size of log it may be cut in different ways to optimize the size and number of resulting boards,Relevant
After boards are cut they are dried and planed,Relevant
Depending on the size of log it may be cut in different ways to optimize the size and number of resulting boards,Irrelevant
After boards are cut they are dried and planed or rotated to make subsequent cuts,Relevant
The headrig sawyer must constantly review the log for internal defects and modify the cutting pattern accordingly as each successive cut opens the log further,Relevant
In general thinner pieces destined to be made into boards are cut from the outer portion of the log where there are fewer knots,Relevant
Thicker pieces for dimension lumber are cut next while the center of the log yields stock for heavy timber pieces,Relevant
Smaller diameter logs are fed through a series of bandsaws that cut them into nominal 1 in 2 5 cm 2 in 5 cm or 4 in 10 cm thick pieces in one pass,Relevant
The large cut pieces from the headrig saw called cants are laid flat and moved by chain conveyor to multiple blade bandsaws where they are cut into the required widths and the outside edges are trimmed square,Relevant
The pieces that were cut from smaller logs may also pass through multiple blade bandsaws to cut them to width,Relevant
If the pieces are small enough that they do not need further cutting they may pass through a chipper which grinds the uneven edges square,Relevant
The cut and trimmed pieces of lumber are then moved to an area to be dried or seasoned,Relevant
This is necessary to prevent decay and to permit the wood to shrink as it dries out Timbers because of their large dimensions are difficult to thoroughly dry and are generally sold wet or green,Relevant
Other lumber may be air dried or kiln dried depending on the required moisture content of the finished piece,Relevant
Air dried lumber is stacked in a covered area with spacers between each piece to allow air to circulate,Relevant
Air dried woods generally contain about 20% moisture,Relevant
Kiln dried lumber is stacked in an enclosed area while 110 180 F 44 82 C heated air is circulated through the stack,Relevant
Kiln dried woods generally contain less than 15% moisture and are often specified for interior floors molding and doors where minimal shrinkage is required,Relevant
The dried pieces of lumber are passed through planers where rotating cutting heads trim the pieces to their final dimensions smooth all four surfaces and round the edges,Relevant
Each piece of lumber is visually or mechanically inspected and graded according to the amount of defects present,Relevant
The grade is stamped on each piece along with information about the moisture content and a mill identification number,Relevant
The lumber is then bundled according to the type of wood grade and moisture content and the bundle is secured with steel bands,Relevant
The bundle is loaded on a truck or train and shipped to a lumber yard for resale to customers,Relevant
The liquid chocolate is poured into tiny molds to create the chocolate centers of the candy,Relevant
If they are peanut or almond M Ms the chocolate surrounds a whole peanut or almond ,Irrelevant
For peanut butter chocolate M Ms the peanut butter center is made first and then surrounded by the chocolate,Relevant
The production process that follows is essentially the same for all varieties,Irrelevant
After the candies are formed they are tumbled to make the chocolate center smooth and rounded,Relevant
Then they are allowed to harden,Relevant
When the chocolates are hard they are transported via conveyor belt to the coating area where the process called panning is performed,Relevant
During panning the chocolates are rotated in large containers as liquid candy made of sugar and corn syrup is sprayed onto them,Relevant
The coats are sprayed on rotating chocolates at timed intervals,Relevant
These intervals allow each coat to dry,Irrelevant
Each coat leaves an even layer a shell of dry candy substance,Relevant
The chocolate centers receive several coatings to ensure a uniform complete coat on every piece,Relevant
The color is added to a finishing syrup and applied as the final coat,Relevant
Each batch is a different color,Irrelevant
Finally the liquid candy dries into the hardened shell,Relevant
The single colored batches are combined into the mixtures of red yellow blue green brown and orange,Irrelevant
They are then transported to the machine that stamps the m on the shells,Relevant
A special conveyor belt carries the pieces to this machine,Relevant
Each piece rests in its own indentation,Irrelevant
The piece runs under rubber etch rollers that gently touch each candy to print the m,Relevant
This machine is specially designed to imprint the m without cracking the thin candy shell,Irrelevant
The process used is similar to the off set printing process,Irrelevant
Approximately 2 6 million M Ms are transported to the etching machine per hour,Irrelevant
One hundred million individual M Ms can be manufactured per day,Irrelevant
A special packaging machine weighs the candies pours the proper amount into individual bags and heat seals the package,Relevant
Plain M Ms are proportioned approximately as follows 30% brown 20% yellow 20% red 10% green 10% orange 10% blue,Relevant
Peanut M Ms are 20% brown 20% yellow 20% red 20% blue 10% green and 10% orange,Relevant
Peanut Butter Chocolate M Ms and Almond M Ms have even proportions 20% each of yellow red green blue and brown,Relevant
The finished packages are moved along a conveyor belt to a machine that assembles the shipping cartons and fills them with the appropriate number of candy packages,Relevant
The machine also seals the cartons shut,Relevant
The individual components of an MRI system are typically manufactured separately and then assembled into a large unit,Irrelevant
These units are extremely heavy sometimes weighing over 100 tons 102 metric tons ,Irrelevant
The most frequently used magnets in an MRI system are superconducting electromagnets,Irrelevant
These can be made using various materials but the basic design involves a coil of conductive wire a cooling system and a power supply,Irrelevant
The coils are made by wrapping wire constructed from filaments of a niobium titanium alloy embedded in copper in a large loop,Relevant
To create the necessary magnetic field a number of coils are used,Relevant
In one type of system eight coils are used six to create the primary magnetic field and two to compensate for the excess field,Irrelevant
The coils are immersed in a vessel containing liquid helium,Relevant
This reduces the temperature to a level that makes them superconductive,Relevant
To help keep the temperature stable the vessel is surrounded by two more vessels containing other coolants like liquid nitrogen,Relevant
This construction is then suspended with thin rods in a vacuum sealed container,Relevant
A power supply is hooked up to the magnetic coils and is used only when the magnet needs to be energized,Relevant
The magnet is attached to the patient support which is a sliding table that brings the patient into the magnetic field,Relevant
The gradient coils are resistant type electromagnets,Irrelevant
In an MRI system there are typically three sets of gradient coils,Irrelevant
Each coil is made by winding thin strips of copper or aluminum in a specific pattern,Relevant
The coils are given strength by introducing an epoxy into their structure,Relevant
The size of these coils determines the width of the opening into which the patient is placed,Relevant
Since a smaller coil requires less energy this width must be large enough to prevent claustrophobia in the patient but small enough to require a reasonable amount of electricity,Irrelevant
These gradient coils are typically shielded to prevent interfering eddy currents,Irrelevant
The electronic components of the RF system may be provided by outside suppliers and assembled by the MRI manufacturer,Irrelevant
These components are attached to the RF coils which are made with varying designs,Relevant
The transmitter and receiver coils are composed of the same type of materials as the gradient coils,Relevant
They are also constructed much like the main magnet,Relevant
However they are made up of a loop of conducting material such as copper that can create an oscillating magnetic field,Relevant
One type of RF coil is a surface coil which is shaped in a circle and is applied directly on the patient,Relevant
Another type is the saddle coil,Irrelevant
These can either be fitted right into the magnet bore or shaped into a birdcage coil and placed just inside the gradient coils,Relevant
Each type of coil is attached to a power source,Relevant
The computer is supplied by computer manufacturers and modified and programmed for use in an MRI system,Relevant
Attached to it is the user interface the Fourier transformer the signal converter and a preamplifier,Relevant
A display device and a laser printer are also included,Relevant
Each of the components of the MRI are assembled together and placed into an appropriate frame,Relevant
Assembly can take place at the plant or on site where the system will be used,Irrelevant
In either case the nature of the magnet typically requires special handling precautions such as transporting it in an air suspended vehicle,Irrelevant
In the making of maple syrup one could say that the farmer comes last and not be wrong,Irrelevant
The sap of the maple will never become maple syrup until the farmer intercedes,Irrelevant
The following five components make up that transformation,Irrelevant
In the winter the maple does not grow and it stores its sap in its roots,Irrelevant
By late spring when the trees begin to produce leaves and flowers a chemical change will have occurred in the sap giving it an unpleasant taste which farmers describe as buddy,Irrelevant
It is only in early spring usually February through April when warm days cause the sap to flow up from the roots to the branches to feed new growth and cold nights cause the sap to return to the roots that the trees can be tapped A W Mayo and Son promoted their family maple syrup and confection business on a sleigh From the collections of Henry Ford Museum   Greenfield Village Americans have always had a sweet tooth Native Americans satisfied their taste for sugar through the production of maple syrup and European settlers of New England learned the practice After the Revolutionary War many farm families in the northern United States and territories produced maple syrup and maple sugar for home consumption Surveyors of new territories noted the presence of sugar trees and settlers named streams near maple groves Sugar Creek,Irrelevant
Cane sugar production in America did not develop until the late eighteenth century,Irrelevant
The growing season in the southern part of the United States did not allow sugar cane to mature and no methods of processing immature cane existed,Irrelevant
In 1795 in what was then French territory Etienne de Bore perfected a means of crystallizing sugar from immature sugar cane in New Orleans,Irrelevant
Other planters copied de Bore and the American cane sugar industry began,Irrelevant
By 1802 75 sugar plantations produced as much as eight million Ib four million kg of brown sugar,Irrelevant
When the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase it gained these sources of sugar production,Irrelevant
Midwestern farmers and later Western producers who used irrigation grew sugar beets to sell to sugar processors,Irrelevant
Sugars from cane and beets are generally used for baking but maple syrup and maple sugar remain popular in spite of other sweeteners,Irrelevant
Families with an affinity for this tasty confection continue to tap trees in the spring and thousands of Americans purchase maple syrup to pour over their morning stack of pancakes,Irrelevant
To tap a maple tree farmers drill a 0 5 in 1 3 cm hole about 2 5 3 in 6 8 cm into the trunk,Relevant
The hole is drilled at a slightly upward angle to prevent sap from collecting in the hole freezing and cracking the trunk,Irrelevant
Care is taken only to drill into the light colored sapwood which will heal and not into the darker heartwood which will not,Irrelevant
Trees from 12 15 in 30 5 38 cm in diameter supports one tap and the number of taps increases as the trees grow larger with a maximum of four taps per tree,Irrelevant
Each tap yields an average of 10 gal 38 1 of sap per season which makes about a quart of syrup,Irrelevant
New holes must be drilled at least 4 in 10 cm above and 6 in 15 cm to either side of previous holes,Irrelevant
This prevents large areas of scar tissue from forming in the wood and leaving the tree open to disease,Irrelevant
Properly cared for the holes will heal completely in one or two years and will cause no damage to the tree,Irrelevant
To collect maple sap holes are drilled into the trees and hollow spikes are inserted,Relevant
Traditionally pails collected the syrup that dripped out but modern systems send the sap directly to the sugar house,Irrelevant
Once the tree is tapped farmers gently drive a hollow spike called a spile into the hole,Irrelevant
The spile is a round hollow piece of wood about the diameter of a broom handle with a metal tip to help drive the end into the wood,Irrelevant
Traditional methods use a canvas bag or a bucket hung from the spile to catch the dripping sap,Irrelevant
The bucket or bag is covered to keep out debris,Irrelevant
Once a day the farmer empties the buckets into a large gathering tank pulled through the fields by a horse or tractor,Irrelevant
The tank is pulled to the building where the sap is processed called the sugar house and emptied into a holding tank,Irrelevant
While the sight of pails hung from maples and the sound of dripping sap is much more romantic than modern systems this traditional method of collection has a few inherent flaws especially for large scale producers,Irrelevant
The first is that collecting syrup bucket by bucket is both time and labor intensive and is therefore costly,Irrelevant
The second is that sap should be processed immediately after being collected in order to produce the best quality syrup,Irrelevant
Under the traditional system if collection exceeds production the sap must be stored,Irrelevant
And if collection falls behind production must slow,Irrelevant
Modern systems eliminate the collection process altogether and send sap straight from the trees to the sugar house,Irrelevant
To accomplish this a plastic tube is attached to each spile the tubes run together to a larger pipe and the pipes in turn run from the various parts of the orchard directly to the sugar house,Irrelevant
A pump maintains a constant slight vacuum and keeps the sap constantly moving through the pipeline,Irrelevant
Collected sap enters the holding tank and then travels to the flue pan,Irrelevant
Here it is heated concentrating the sap and causing a chemical change,Relevant
Maple sap becomes maple syrup at the moment when its concentration of sugar reaches 66%,Relevant
The syrup is filtered and poured into containers,Relevant
Possibly the most important piece of the maple syrup making process takes place in the sugar house,Irrelevant
The initial sugar content of the sap its clarity and to some extent its taste are all determined by weather soil and ultimately the tree all of which are outside the control of the grower,Irrelevant
It is only through the process of heating and condensing the sap that it takes on the distinctive sweet flavor of maple syrup,Irrelevant
Most commercial syrup producers use a continuous feed system to make syrup,Irrelevant
Sap continuously but very slowly enters from a holding tank on one end and finished syrup is continuously drained and bottled at the other end,Relevant
The sap is heated over a wood or oil fueled fire in a series of long shallow stainless steel pans,Relevant
This causes the water in the sap to steam off condensing the sap and causes a chemical change in the sap which brings out a flavor not present before it is heated,Irrelevant
The sap first enters the flue pan which has a corrugated bottom lined with a series of pipes called flues,Relevant
The flues serve two purposes,Irrelevant
First the fire heats the air inside the flues which provides a more even gentle heat than the fire gives directly and which allows the sap to be heated longer and at a higher temperature evaporating more water without the danger of scorching the sap,Relevant
Second the wavy pan bottom increases the surface area of the pan and allows more syrup to be in contact with the heat at the same time,Relevant
From the flue pan the sap flows into the flat bottomed syrup pan where it is finished,Relevant
The two pans are divided by partitions that allow a slow constant flow of sap,Relevant
Maple sap becomes maple syrup at the moment when its concentration of sugar reaches 66%,Irrelevant
Producers test this concentration using two methods,Relevant
The first uses the formula that syrup is finished when it reaches the temperature at which water boils plus 7 1 F 4 3 C ,Relevant
Because water boils at different temperatures depending on altitude producers boil a sample of water and measure its temperature,Irrelevant
When the syrup reaches the sample s temperature plus 7 1 F 4 3 C it is done,Relevant
The second perhaps more scientific method involves an instrument called a hydrometer,Irrelevant
A hydrometer is a sealed glass tube with a small amount of weight in one end,Irrelevant
Running horizontally around the outside of the tube are a series of lines which indicate concentration in percentage the lines are specially calibrated for maple syrup,Irrelevant
Once the sap has been heated a sample is placed in a cylinder and the hydrometer is placed in the sap,Relevant
The hydrometer sinks to the line that indicates the current sugar concentration in the sap,Relevant
When the hydrometer sinks to the line that indicates 66% the sap has become syrup,Relevant
As the sugar approaches 66% it is checked constantly,Relevant
Finishing the syrup at the proper sugar concentration is critical too high and the syrup will crystallize too low and it will spoil,Relevant
Once the syrup is properly finished it is poured through a cloth filter to remove any sugar sand called nitre,Relevant
It is then poured into glass or metal containers while still hot,Relevant
The container is filled to the very top and then tightly sealed,Relevant
Because maple syrup contains no preservatives this final step ensures that the container is sterile and airtight and prevents any spoiling,Irrelevant
The ink mixture is concocted,Relevant
Preferable ratios are 1 10 % water by weight the water content must be sufficient for complete dissolution or dispersion of the dye with the remainder of the weight being made up of a solvent such as alkyl or alkylene carbonate,Irrelevant
Conventional additives such as nonylphenylpolyglycol ether alkylpoly glycol ether fatty acid polyglycol ester or fatty alcohol ethoxalates and preservatives such as ortho phenolphenyl and its sodium salt ortho hydroxydiphenyl or 6 acetoxy 2 4 dimethhyl m dioxane may also be added to the mixture,Relevant
To make the body of the marker plastic resin is injection molded into a marker body,Relevant
Injection molding involves heating a substance in this case plastic resin into a molten state and forcing injecting it into a mold of the desired shape then allowing it to cool and harden,Relevant
Marker caps and plugs are formed in the same manner as the barrel,Relevant
The nib or tip of the marker is made from powder which is mixed with water molded and baked into its pointed or flat form,Relevant
Using one machine for all the following functions an assembler then places a polyester cylinder inside the marker barrel to form a reservoir for the ink fills the reservoir with ink and inserts the nib at the bottom and the cap at the top,Relevant
The markers are then placed into color assortment and packaged for retail marketing,Relevant
A solution is formed by dissolving sugar and corn syrup in water and boiling it,Relevant
Egg whites and or gelatin is mixed with the sugar solution,Relevant
Then the ingredients are heated in a cook kettle to about 240 F 115 C ,Relevant
The resulting mixture is passed through a strainer to remove extraneous matter,Relevant
In the pump the mixture is then beaten into a foam to two or three times its original volume,Relevant
At this stage flavoring can be added,Relevant
Paradise pudding from the recipe booklet The Jell O Girl Entertains circa 1930,Irrelevant
In the early twentieth century marshmallows were considered a child s confection dispensed as penny candy at general stores along with licorice whips and peppermint drops,Irrelevant
But through a fortuitous connection with other popular foods and some clever marketing marshmallows would soon become a staple ingredient at pot luck dinners family get togethers and even elegant parties,Irrelevant
A perusal through twentieth century cookbooks and recipe booklets reveals that marshmallows usually served as an ingredient in cakes candies and desserts,Irrelevant
They also became well known as a topping for steaming cups of hot cocoa and as a roasted treat at cookouts and picnics,Irrelevant
Increasingly they served as a sweet addition to salads and side dishes including their classic contribution to the Thanksgiving dinner tableatop a dish of baked sweet potatoes or yarns,Irrelevant
The heated mixture is transferred to a heat exchanger,Relevant
Air is pumped into the mixture,Relevant
The mixture cools in a tempering kettle passes through another filter and Marshmallow continues on to the hill,Relevant
Marshmallows are extruded through a machine or deposited onto bands,Relevant
The extrusion process involves the foam being squeezed through a die to produce marshmallow s familiar pillow shape,Relevant
Usually they get a coating of corn starch to counter stickiness and help maintain their form after they have been extruded,Relevant
Sometimes the pillows are formed into a rope of pillows,Relevant
If so they are cut and dried on a rubber conveyor belt,Relevant
After the pillows are formed they are sent through a cooling drum where excess starch is removed,Relevant
They also are cooled enough to be packaged,Relevant
After the pillows have cooled they are weighed and packaged,Relevant
Before being put in cases some manufacturers pass their product through a metal detector,Relevant
The case is code dated and shipped to retail stores,Relevant
There are two main types of mascara currently manufactured,Irrelevant
One type is called anhydrous meaning it contains no water,Irrelevant
The second type is made with a lotion base and it is manufactured by the emulsion method,Irrelevant
In this method ingredients are mixed in tanks or kettles which make a small batch of 10 30 gal 38 114 1 ,Relevant
The ingredients are first carefully measured and weighed,Relevant
Then a worker empties them into the mixing tank,Relevant
Heat is applied to melt the waxes and the mixture is agitated usually by means of a propeller blade,Relevant
The agitation continues until the mixture reaches a semi solid state,Relevant
Mascara can be made in two different ways,Irrelevant
In the anhydrous method all the ingredients are mixed heated and agitated,Irrelevant
With the emulsion method water and thickeners are combined while the waxes and emulsifiers are mixed and heated separately,Relevant
Pigments are added before both mixtures are combined in a high speed agitator called a homogenizer,Relevant
The result of either method is a semi solid substance that is ready to be packaged,Relevant
In this method water and thickeners are combined to make a lotion or cream base,Relevant
Waxes and emulsifiers are heated and melted separately and pigments are added,Relevant
Then the waxes and lotion base are combined in a very high speed mixer or homogenizer,Relevant
Unlike the tank or kettle above the homogenizer is enclosed and mixes the ingredients at very high speed without incorporating any air or causing evaporation,Relevant
The oils and waxes are broken down into very small beads by the rapid action of the homogenizer and held in suspension in the water,Relevant
The homogenizer may hold as little as 5 gal 19 1 or as much as 100 gal 380 1 ,Irrelevant
The high speed mixing action continues until the mixture reaches room temperature,Relevant
After the mascara solution has cooled or reached the proper state workers transfer it to a tote bin,Relevant
Next they roll the tote bin to the filling area and empty the solution into a hopper on a filling machine,Relevant
The filling machine pumps a measured amount typically about 0 175 oz [5 g] of the solution into glass or plastic mascara bottles,Relevant
The bottles are usually capped by hand,Relevant
Samples are removed for inspection and the rest are readied for distribution,Relevant
Matches are manufactured in several stages,Irrelevant
In the case of wooden stick matches the matchsticks are first cut prepared and moved to a storage area,Irrelevant
When the matchsticks are needed they are inserted into holes in a long perforated belt,Relevant
The belt carries them through the rest of the process where they are dipped into several chemical tanks dried and packaged in boxes,Relevant
Cardboard stick matches used in match books are processed in a similar manner,Irrelevant
Here is a typical sequence of operations for manufacturing wooden stick matches ,Irrelevant
Logs of white pine or aspen are clamped in a debarking machine and slowly rotated while spinning blades cut away the outer bark of the tree,Relevant
The stripped logs are then cut into short lengths about 1 6 ft 0 5 m long,Relevant
Each length is placed in a peeler and rotated while a sharp flat blade peels a long thin sheet of wood from the outer surface of the log,Relevant
This sheet is about 0 1 in 2 5 mm thick and is called a veneer,Irrelevant
The peeling blade moves inward toward the core of the rotating log until only a small round post is left,Relevant
This post is discarded and may be used for fuel or reduced to wood chips for use in making paper or chipboard,Relevant
Stripped logs are placed in a peeler which cuts a sheet about 0 1 in 2 5 mm thick called veneer from the log,Relevant
The veneer proceeds to the chopper which cuts it into small sticks,Relevant
The sticks are soaked in a dilute solution of ammonium phosphate and dried removing splinters and crystallized solution,Relevant
The matches are dumped into a feed hopper which lines them up,Relevant
A perforated conveyor belt holds them upside down while they are dipped in a series of three tanks,Relevant
The matches are dried for 50 60 minutes before they are packaged,Relevant
The sheets of veneer are stacked and fed into a chopper,Relevant
The chopper has many sharp blades that cut down through the stack to produce as many as 1 000 matchsticks in a single stroke,Relevant
The cut matchsticks are dumped into a large vat filled with a dilute solution of ammonium phosphate,Relevant
After they have soaked for several minutes the matchsticks are removed from the vat and placed in a large rotating drum like a clothes dryer,Relevant
The tumbling action inside the drum dries the sticks and acts to polish and clean them of any splinters or crystallized chemical,Relevant
The dried sticks are then dumped into a hopper and blown through a metal duct to the storage area,Relevant
In some operations the sticks are blown directly into the matchmaking facility rather than going to storage,Relevant
The sticks are blown from the storage area to a conveyor belt that transfers them to be inserted into holes on a long continuous perforated steel belt,Relevant
The sticks are dumped into several v shaped feed hoppers that line them up with the holes in the perforated belt,Relevant
Plungers push the matchsticks into the holes across the width of the slowly moving belt,Relevant
A typical belt may have 50 100 holes spaced across its width,Irrelevant
Any sticks that do not seat firmly into the holes fall to a catch area beneath the belt and are transferred back to the feed hoppers,Relevant
The perforated belt holds the matchsticks upside down and immerses the lower portion of the sticks in a bath of hot paraffin wax,Relevant
After they emerge from the wax the sticks are allowed to dry,Relevant
Further down the line the matchsticks are positioned over a tray filled with a liquid solution of the match head chemicals,Relevant
The tray is then momentarily raised to immerse the ends of the sticks in the solution,Relevant
Several thousand sticks are coated at the same time,Irrelevant
This cycle repeats itself when the next batch of sticks is in position,Relevant
If the matches are the strike anywhere kind the sticks move on to another tray filled with a solution of the tip chemicals and the match ends are immersed in that tray only this time not quite as deeply,Relevant
This gives strike anywhere matches their characteristic two toned appearance,Irrelevant
After the match heads are coated the matches must be dried very slowly or they will not light properly,Relevant
The belt loops up and down several times as the matches dry for 50 60 minutes,Relevant
The cardboard inner and outer portions of the match boxes are cut printed folded and glued together in a separate area,Relevant
If the box is to contain safety matches the chemicals for the striking strip are mixed with an adhesive and are automatically applied to the outer portion of the box,Relevant
When the matches are dry the belt moves them to the packaging area where a multi toothed wheel pushes the finished matches out of the holes in the belt,Relevant
The matches fall into hoppers which measure the proper amount of matches for each box,Relevant
The matches are dumped from the hoppers into the inner portions of the cardboard match boxes which are moving along a conveyor belt located below the hoppers,Relevant
Ten or more boxes may be filled at the same time,Irrelevant
The outer portions of the match boxes move along another conveyor belt running parallel to the first belt,Relevant
Both conveyors stop momentarily and the filled inner portions are pushed into the outer portions,Relevant
This cycle of filling the inner portions and pushing them into the outer portions is repeated at a rate of about once per second,Relevant
The filled match boxes are moved by conveyor belt to a machine which groups them and places them in a corrugated cardboard box for shipping,Relevant
Metal hardware components are manufactured from steel or steel and zinc alloys using precision metalworking equipment such as lathes and drill presses,Irrelevant
If the external body shell of an inexpensive microscope is plastic it is usually a light rigid plastic such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS plastic,Irrelevant
ABS plastic components are made by injection molding,Relevant
The plastic is then allowed to cool back into a solid,Relevant
The mold is opened and the product is removed,Relevant
The proper raw materials for the type of optical glass desired are mixed in the proper proportions along with waste glass of the same type,Relevant
This waste glass known as cullet acts as a flux,Irrelevant
A flux is a substance which causes raw materials to react at a lower temperature than they would without it,Irrelevant
The mixture is heated in a glass furnace until it has melted into a liquid,Relevant
The temperature varies with the type of glass being made but is typically about 2550 F 1400 C ,Relevant
The temperature is raised to about 2800 F 1550 C to force air bubbles to rise to the surface,Relevant
It is then slowly cooled and stirred constantly until it has reached a temperature of about 1800 F 1000 C ,Relevant
The glass is now an extremely thick liquid which is poured into molds shaped like the lenses to be made,Irrelevant
When the glass has cooled to about 600 F 300 C it is reheated to about 1000 F 500 C ,Relevant
This process known as annealing removes internal stresses which form during the initial cooling period and which weaken the glass,Relevant
The glass is then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature,Relevant
The pieces of glass are removed from the molds,Relevant
They are now known as blanks,Relevant
The blank is now placed in a vise and held beneath a rapidly rotating cylindrical cutter with a diamond blade,Relevant
This cutter known as a curve generator trims the surface of the blank until a close approximation of the desired curve is obtained,Relevant
The cut lens is inspected and cut again if necessary,Relevant
The difficulty of this process varies widely depending on the type of glass being cut and the exact curvature required,Irrelevant
Several cuttings may be required and the time involved may be a few minutes or more than half an hour,Irrelevant
Several cut blanks are placed on the surface of a curved block in such a way that their curved surfaces line up as if they were all part of one spherical surface,Relevant
This allows many lenses to be ground at the same time,Irrelevant
A cast iron grinding surface known as a tool is placed on top on the lenses,Relevant
The block of lenses rotates while the tool moves at random on top of it,Relevant
A steady flow of liquid moves between the tool and the lenses,Relevant
This liquid known as a slurry contains water an abrasive usually silicon carbide to do the grinding a coolant to prevent overheating and a surfactant to keep the abrasive from settling out of the slurry,Relevant
The lenses are inspected after grinding and reground if necessary,Relevant
The grinding process may take one to eight hours,Irrelevant
The lenses are moved to a polishing machine,Relevant
This is similar to the grinding machine but the tool is made of pitch a thick soft resin derived from tar ,Irrelevant
A pitch tool is made by placing tape around a curved dish pouring in hot liquid pitch and letting it cool back into a solid,Relevant
A pitch tool can be used about 50 times before it must be reshaped,Irrelevant
It works in the same manner as a grinding tool but instead of an abrasive the slurry contains a polishing substance usually cerium dioxide ,Irrelevant
The lenses are inspected after polishing and the procedure is repeated as necessary,Relevant
Polishing may take from half an hour to five hours,Irrelevant
The lenses are cleaned and ready to be coated,Relevant
The lenses are coated with magnesium fluoride,Relevant
They are then inspected again labeled with a date of manufacture and a serial number and stored until needed,Relevant
If a mirror is included it is made in a way similar to the way in which a lens is made,Irrelevant
Unlike a lens it is cut ground and polished to be flat rather than curved,Relevant
A reflective coating is then applied,Relevant
Aluminum is heated in a vacuum to produce a vapor,Relevant
A negative electrostatic charge is applied to the surface of the mirror so that it attracts the positively charged aluminum ions,Relevant
This allows a thin even coating of metal to be applied,Relevant
A protective coating of silicon dioxide is then applied,Relevant
Like a lens the mirror is inspected labeled and stored,Relevant
All of the final assembly of the microscope is done by hand,Irrelevant
The workers wear gloves masks and gowns so that dirt does not damage the lenses or the internal mechanisms of the microscope,Irrelevant
First the Microscopelenses are placed in the steel tubes which make up the bodies of the eyepiece and the objective,Relevant
These tubes are manufactured in standard sizes which allow them to be assembled into a standard size microscope,Relevant
The focusing mechanism of most microscopes is a rack and pinion system,Irrelevant
This consists of a flat piece of metal with teeth on one side the rack and a metal wheel with teeth the pinion which controls the movement of the rack,Irrelevant
The rack and pinion direct the objective so that its movement toward or away from the object being observed can be controlled,Irrelevant
In many microscopes the rack and pinion are attached to the stage the flat metal plate on which the object being observed rests and the objective remains stationary,Irrelevant
After the rack and pinion system is installed the knobs that control it are attached,Relevant
The external body shell of the microscope is assembled around the internal focusing mechanism,Relevant
The eyepiece or two eyepieces for a binocular microscope and objective or a rotating disk containing several different objectives are screwed into place,Relevant
Eyepieces and objectives are manufactured in standard sizes that allow many different eyepieces and objectives to be used in any standard microscope,Relevant
If the microscope contains a mirror this is attached to the body of the microscope below the opening in the stage,Relevant
If it contains a light bulb instead this may be attached in the same place to shine light through the observed object or it may be placed to the side of the stage to shine light on top of the object ,Relevant
Some professional microscopes contain both kinds of light bulbs to allow both kinds of observation,Relevant
If the microscope contains a camera it is attached to the top of the body,Irrelevant
The microscope is tested,Relevant
If it functions correctly the eyepiece and objective are usually unscrewed before packing,Relevant
The parts of the microscope are packed securely in close fitting compartments lined with cloth or foam,Relevant
These compartments are often part of a wood or steel box,Relevant
The microscope is then placed in a strong cardboard container and shipped to consumers,Relevant
The production of mosquito repellents can be broken down into two steps,Irrelevant
First a large batch of the repellent formulation is made and then the batch is filled into the packaging,Relevant
Since aerosols are the most common form of mosquito repellent the following Mosquito Repellent description details their production,Irrelevant
Other forms of repellents like creams and lotions are produced in a similar way except that the filling process is less involved,Irrelevant
The first step in the manufacturing process is compounding,Irrelevant
In the compounding area raw materials are mixed together in large stainless steel tanks,Relevant
For an aerosol the alcohol is pumped into the tank and the other materials including DEET fragrance and emollients are manually poured in and allowed to mix,Relevant
All of the ingredients except the propellant are added at this phase of production,Relevant
Since some of the materials in this process are flammable special precautions are taken to prevent explosion such as using spark proof electrical outlets and blast proof walls,Relevant
When the batch is finished a sample is sent to the quality control lab and tested to make sure it meets the set standards for the product,Relevant
After passing these tests it is pumped to the filling lines to make the finished product,Relevant
The filling line is a series of machines connected by a conveyor belt system that combine all of the components to make the finished mosquito repellent product,Irrelevant
The first machine in the system feeds the empty cans onto the conveyor line,Relevant
This machine has a large hopper that is filled with empty Mosquito Repellentcans which are physically manipulated until they are standing upright and correctly oriented,Irrelevant
The metal cans are then automatically moved along the conveyor belt and cleaned with a jet of compressed air to remove any dust and debris,Relevant
They next travel to the filling carousel,Relevant
The filling carousel is made up of a series of piston filling heads that are calibrated to deliver exactly the correct amount of product into the cans,Irrelevant
As the cans move through this section of the filling line they are filled with product,Relevant
The next step in the filling process involves topping the cans with a valve adding the propellant and pressurizing the cans,Irrelevant
The valve is put on by the valve inserter machine,Relevant
Much like the bin that holds the empty cans the valves are also put in a hopper and then correctly sorted and aligned,Relevant
As the cans pass by the valves are put on,Relevant
These valves are then tightly affixed to the can by the valve crimping machine,Relevant
Depending on the type of filling technique the propellant is either injected through the valve at high pressure or injected into the can before the valve is crimped,Relevant
After the cans are capped and filled they are moved to a hot tank a long trough filled with hot water,Relevant
Here the cans are checked for escaping bubbles that would indicate a propellant leak,Relevant
The high temperature of the waterbath also raises the internal pressure of the can which is intended to cause any weak spots in the can to fail,Relevant
This is a crucial quality control step that prevents damaged cans from being sold to the public,Irrelevant
When the cans exit the waterbath they are dried by high pressure air jets,Relevant
Other components are then added such as the actuating button and the overcap,Relevant
Any needed labels or printing are also added at this point,Relevant
The finished cans are then moved to the boxing area where they are put into boxes typically a dozen cans at a time,Relevant
These boxes are then stacked onto pallets and hauled away in large trucks to distributors,Relevant
High speed aerosol production lines like the one described can move at speeds of about 200 cans per minute or more,Irrelevant
The exact manufacturing process depends on the type of patch being constructed,Irrelevant
In general patch membranes are made by one of several techniques all of which are designed to create a series of uniform diffusion pores,Irrelevant
For example in the polymer precipitation method a polymer film is cast on a steel belt containing a solvent water mixture,Relevant
As the polymer film hardens the solvent evaporates and creates a multitude of tiny holes,Relevant
Porous membranes can also be created by stretching a thin melted film of polymer,Relevant
As the film is uniformly stretched small pores are formed,Relevant
This method is typically used for Nicotine Patch polypropylene films,Irrelevant
Polycarbonate films can be perforated by exposure to certain forms of nuclear particles,Irrelevant
Regardless of the process the goal is to create a thin plastic membrane with a multitude of microscopic channels through which the drug can diffuse,Irrelevant
These membranes can be attached to the plastic housing containing the drug in subsequent operations,Relevant
In systems where the drug is intermingled with the patch material like the matrix type and the mixed adhesive type the process is somewhat different,Irrelevant
The mixture is prepared in a special type of mixer known as a Hockenmeyer mixer,Relevant
The adhesive is added first and premixed at high speeds for a predetermined period of time,Relevant
Next other additives such as viscosity control agents may be added and further mixing occurs,Relevant
Then the drug component is slowly added and the mixing speed is increased,Relevant
Final adjustments in pH or viscosity may be made at this point,Relevant
Final processing depends on the type of carrier,Irrelevant
Reservoir type patches must be filled with the drug mixture,Relevant
The drug adhesive matrix described above is coated onto silicone treated polyester film,Relevant
The silicone ensures the patch can be easily removed to expose the adhesive layer,Relevant
The completed patch is oven dried to remove solvents and then laminated to a carrier or backing strip,Relevant
This backing strip can be further processed by die cutting and then packaged as a finished product,Relevant
After the ripe olives have been combed from the trees they are picked over by hand to weed out unsound olives,Relevant
The olives are divided into categories according to their plumpness state of ripeness and quality,Relevant
Then the olives are taken to the press and stored for a short period of time from a few hours to several days,Relevant
The period is short enough to prevent fermentation but long enough to allow the olives to get warm so that they release their oil easily,Irrelevant
The olives are rinsed in cold water and then passed along a conveyer belt between rollers or continuous hammers,Relevant
This machinery often called the olive crusher breaks down the cells and de stones the olives,Relevant
Depending on the resiliency of the olives skin and the stage of maturation it may be necessary to pass the fruit through the mill a second time,Relevant
In ancient times the olives were mashed into a paste with a simple mortar and pestle,Irrelevant
This principle was expanded upon until the stone mortars were large enough to require slaves or pack animals to operate them,Irrelevant
In the modern process the milled olives travel from the mill into vats in which slowly turning blades mash the olives into a homogenized paste,Relevant
The oil is extracted by loading the paste into a hydraulic press,Relevant
The olive paste is evenly spread over hemp pressing bags or disks covered with synthetic fibers,Relevant
Each bag or disk is covered with approximately 9 13 lb 4 6 kg of paste,Relevant
Between 25 and 50 bags or disks are stacked onto a press plate,Relevant
Plate guides are inserted at intervals of five to six bags,Relevant
The plates serve to maintain the balance of the stack and to distribute the pressure evenly,Irrelevant
A piston pushes up against the stack and the oil seeps slowly through the pressing bags to attached tubes,Relevant
The solid material remains inside the pressing bags,Relevant
The term cold pressing refers to the fact that the oil is extracted without heating the paste furthering insuring the purity of the oil,Irrelevant
The oil that is expressed is a reddish mixture of the oil and the inherent vegetable water,Irrelevant
This is the oil that receives the appellation of extra virgin olive oil,Relevant
The paste is removed from the bags and run through several more presses to obtain the lesser grades of oil that remain,Relevant
Originally the oil and water mixture was stored in vats until the oil rose to the top and was skimmed off,Irrelevant
Some fermentation was inevitable affecting the taste and smell of the olive oil,Irrelevant
Today the separation is accomplished swiftly by pumping the mixture into a centrifuge,Relevant
The centrifuge is comprised of a rotating drum and an auger that are spun on the same axis at great speed,Irrelevant
Because the oil and the vegetable water are of differing densities the centrifuge forces them apart and into separate receptacles,Relevant
The oil is stored in underground vats until it is ready to be shipped,Relevant
Then the oil is canned or bottled on an assembly line,Relevant
Cans or dark tinted bottles will keep the deep green color of the olive oil intact,Relevant
Oil placed in clear glass bottles will fade to a yellowish green,Irrelevant
However the flavor is not affected,Irrelevant
In many cases olive oil distributors purchase the olive from the producers and rebottle it,Relevant
Packaging has become more ornate as the popularity of olive oil has grown,Relevant
It is not unusual to purchase olive oil in unusually shaped bottles topped with netting or rope,Relevant
Some packagers also hire professional artists to design their labels,Relevant
Pacemakers are sophisticated electronic devices,Irrelevant
Therefore some manufacturers rely on outside suppliers to provide many of the component parts,Irrelevant
The construction of a pacemaker is not a linear process but an integrated one,Irrelevant
Component parts such as the battery leads and the circuitry are constructed individually then pieced together to form the final product,Irrelevant
The primary type of battery used in pacemakers is a lithium iodine cell,Irrelevant
One method used by manufacturers to make these batteries involves first mixing together the iodine and a polymer such as poly2 vinylpyridine PVP ,Relevant
They are heated together forming a molten charge transfer complex,Relevant
This liquid is then poured into a half moon shaped preformed cell which contains the other components of the battery including the lithium anode positive charge and a cathode collector screen,Relevant
The iodine polymer blend solidifies as it cools to form the cathode,Relevant
After the cathode is formed the battery is hermetically sealed to prevent moisture from entering,Relevant
The leads are typically composed of a metal alloy,Irrelevant
The wire is made by an extrusion process in which the metal is heated until it is molten then pushed through an appropriately sized opening,Relevant
It is cut then bundled with many other wires and treated with a polymeric insulator such as polyurethane,Relevant
One end of the lead wires is fashioned with a shaped tip and the other is fitted with a pacemaker connector,Relevant
The motherboard contains all the electrical circuitry of the pacemaker including Pacemakerthe semiconductor chips resistors capacitors and other devices,Irrelevant
Using a complex method known as hybridization these components are combined to form a single complex circuit,Relevant
Construction begins with a small board less than 0 32 sq in [2 sq cm] which has the electronic configuration mapped out,Irrelevant
The appropriate components are put in place on the board,Relevant
They are then affixed using a minimum number of soldering welds,Relevant
When all of the component pieces are available final assembly takes place,Relevant
The circuitry is connected to the battery and both are inserted into the metal casing,Relevant
The casing used for a pacemaker is typically formed using titanium or a titanium alloy,Irrelevant
It is constructed in multiple pieces that are sealed together after the other pacemaker components are introduced,Relevant
A fitting is also affixed to the casing providing a connecting point for the leads,Relevant
The finished devices are then put into final packaging along with accessories,Relevant
After being exhaustively tested they are then sent out to distributors and finally to doctors,Relevant
In the United States all paper money is engraved and printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing which is part of the Department of the Treasury of the federal government,Irrelevant
The Bureau also prints postage stamps savings bonds treasury notes and many other items,Relevant
The main production facility is located in Washington D C and there is a smaller facility in Fort Worth Texas,Irrelevant
Every day the Bureau prints approximately 38 million pieces of paper money,Irrelevant
About 45% of this production are $1 bills and 25% are $20 bills,Irrelevant
The rest of the production is divided between $5 $10 $50 and $100 bills,Irrelevant
Although the $2 bill is still in circulation it is rarely used and therefore is rarely printed,Irrelevant
Each bill regardless of its denomination costs the government about 3 8 cents to produce,Irrelevant
There are 65 separate operations in the production of paper money,Irrelevant
Here are the major steps ,Irrelevant
Engravers hand cut the design into a piece of soft steel known as the master die using very fine engraving tools and a magnifying glass,Relevant
The portrait and images consist of numerous lines dots and dashes which are cut in various sizes and shapes,Irrelevant
The fine crosshatched lines in the background of the portrait are produced by a ruling machine and the scrollwork in the borders are cut using a geometric lathe,Relevant
Every time a new Treasurer of the United States or a new Secretary of the Treasury is appointed their signatures must be engraved on a new master die for each denomination bill,Irrelevant
First the signatures are photographically enlarged,Relevant
An engraver then traces the signatures by hand with one end of a device known as a pantograph,Relevant
This motion is mechanically reduced through a set of linkages causing several diamond tipped needles on the other end of the pantograph to cut the signatures into the master dies,Irrelevant
Once the master die has been inspected it is heated and a thin plastic sheet is pressed into it to form a raised impression of the design,Relevant
Thirty two of these raised plastic impressions are bonded together in a configuration of four across and eight down to form what is known as an alto,Relevant
The master die is then placed in storage,Relevant
The plastic alto is placed in an electrolytic plating tank and is plated with copper,Relevant
The plastic is stripped away leaving a thin plate of metal known as a basso with 32 recessed impressions of the design,Relevant
The metal basso is then cleaned polished and inspected,Relevant
If it passes inspection it is plated with chromium to make the surface hard and it becomes a master printing plate,Relevant
Printing the front and back of the bills 5 The principal printing process is known as intaglio printing,Irrelevant
This process is used because of its ability to produce extremely fine detail that remains legible under repeated handling and is difficult to counterfeit,Irrelevant
A stack of 10 000 sheets of paper is loaded into a high speed rotary intaglio printing press,Relevant
Each sheet is sized to allow 32 individual bills to be printed on the same sheet,Relevant
The paper is inspected to ensure that it contains the proper security thread for the denomination to be printed,Relevant
A master printing plate of the proper denomination is secured around the master plate cylinder in the press,Relevant
The rotating master printing plate is coated with ink,Relevant
A wiper removes the ink from the surface of the plate leaving only the ink that is trapped in the engraved recesses of the design,Relevant
A sheet of paper is fed into the press where it passes between the master plate cylinder and a hard smooth impression cylinder under pressures reaching 15 000 psi 1 034 bar ,Relevant
The impression cylinder forces the paper into the fine engraved lines of the printing plate to pick up the ink leaving a raised image about 0 0008 in 0 02 mm above the paper,Relevant
This process is repeated at a rate of about 10 000 sheets per hour,Irrelevant
The printed sheets are then stacked on top of each other,Relevant
The backs are printed with green ink first and are allowed to dry for 24 48 hours before the fronts are printed with black ink,Relevant
After the intaglio printing process the stacks are cut into two stacks of 10 000 sheets and are visually examined for defects,Relevant
Each sheet is fed into a letterpress which prints the colored Treasury seal and serial numbers on the face of the bills,Relevant
Sixteen serial numbers are printed at the same time,Irrelevant
The press then automatically advances the numbers before the next sheet of sixteen is printed,Relevant
The numbers on any sheet are separated by 20 000 between adjacent bills,Irrelevant
Thus the bill in the upper left hand corner of the first sheet would be serial number 0000001 and the one below it on the same sheet would be 0020001 and so on,Irrelevant
On the second sheet all the numbers would advance by one giving 0000002 in the upper left 0020002 below it etc,Irrelevant
In this manner when the sheets are cut into separate stacks the bills within each stack will have sequential serial numbers,Irrelevant
The finished sheets are inspected with machine sensors and any printing errors folded paper inclusion of foreign objects or other defects are identified,Relevant
Any bills which are found to be defective are marked for later removal,Relevant
Such bills are replaced with star notes which are numbered in a different sequence and have a star printed after the serial number,Relevant
The sheets are gathered in stacks of 100 and cut into 16 individual stacks of 100 bills each with a vertical guillotine knife,Relevant
Any bills which have been identified as defective are replaced with star notes at this time,Relevant
The stacks of 100 bills are then wrapped with a paper band,Relevant
The banded stacks are given a final visual inspection and are shrink wrapped with plastic in bundles of 10 stacks,Relevant
Four of these 10 stack bundles are then wrapped together to form a brick before they are shipped to the various federal reserve banks and other agencies,Relevant
Steinway s method of rim bending is still used and is the first step in assembling the grand piano,Irrelevant
Layers of long fiber maple wood are glued together and bent in a metal press to form a continuous rim both the inner and outer rim are made this way,Relevant
Up to 22 layers form each piano rim and the layers may be up to 25 ft 7 62 m long,Irrelevant
Resin glue is applied by machine then the layers are carried to the press where they are shaped,Relevant
The rims are stored in braces to keep them from changing shape,Relevant
They are seasoned in controlled temperature and humidity conditions until the wood meets a specific moisture content where it will hold its contour,Relevant
The bent inner rim is then fitted with other wood components including the cross block the pinblock the cross braces the keybed and the backbottom,Relevant
These are glued and doweled in place,Relevant
The cabinet is finished to improve sound properties as well as for appearance,Relevant
The cabinet is sanded so stain is absorbed properly wood is bleached to equalize appearance of the veneer prestaining and staining are done next wood fillers sometimes with a washcoat are added and a first coat of sealer or lacquer is applied,Relevant
The surface is sanded again special glazes for antiquing or other effects are added followed by two more coats of lacquer sanding is done again special trims are added and two final coats of lacquer are used,Relevant
The cabinet is dried for up to 21 days before it is hand rubbed to its final finish,Relevant
The wood components of the piano collectively called the framework the pinblock and the cast iron plateare the parts of the piano that support the tension of the strings,Irrelevant
Braces are made of select spruce and the pinblock or wrestplank is constructed of bonded layers of rock maple,Irrelevant
The pinblock is quarter sawn or rotary cut to maximize the grain structure s grip on the tuning pins,Relevant
The laminated layers are also glued at different angles to each other so that the pins are surrounded with end grain wood,Relevant
The pinblock has one hole per string or up to 240 holes drilled in it,Irrelevant
The cast iron plate is made in a piano plate foundry,Relevant
Match plates are made of metal from the wood pattern designed by the engineer with top and bottom pieces to match,Irrelevant
Sand molds are made from the match plates and these are used to cast the plate,Relevant
Molten iron is poured through the molds and allowed to harden during the founding process a controlled cooling process to produce a plate weighing about 600 lb 272 4 kg ,Relevant
After the plate is cooled and removed from the molds sand is blasted off the plate with steel grit,Relevant
The plate is transported on overhead conveyors to a drill room where holes are drilled for the tuning pins nosebolts bolts to the frame and hitch pins,Relevant
The hitch pins are inserted next then the casting imperfections are removed from the plate by grinding and drilling,Relevant
Oils are also removed,Relevant
The plate is hand sanded and rubbed primed and painted,Relevant
The cast iron plate is suspended above its piano during the process of fitting,Relevant
The plate will be lowered and raised in and out of the piano several times as the pinblock seal against the rim and the sound board and bridges are fitted,Relevant
The soundboard is a thin panel of spruce that underlies the strings and the cast iron plate and rests on the rim braces,Irrelevant
Its parts are the board itself supporting ribs on the underside of the board and the two bridges over which the strings are stretched,Irrelevant
The soundboard is made of spruce that is 0 25 0 375 in 0635 0 95 cm thick it acts as a natural resonator is strong for its weight and can be vibrated by the strings because of its lightness,Irrelevant
Spruce is air dried then kiln dried to a specific moisture content,Relevant
It is then cut into strips that are 2 5 in 5 4453 8 7 cm wide the edges are glued and the strips are pressed together and dried,Relevant
A pattern is superimposed and the soundboard is trimmed to grand piano size,Relevant
The soundboard is curved to produce the right sound,Relevant
The curve is called a crown that arches upward toward the strings,Relevant
The arch is made by fitting ribs of lightweight spruce or sugar pine wood to the underside of the board,Relevant
The ribs are carefully cut from patterns then fitted and glued to the sound board using a rib press that accurately positions the ribs then forces the board into the proper curvature,Relevant
The ribs are cut along the wood s lengthwise grain and fitted at right angles to the lengthwise grain of the sound board so that vibrations are evenly transmitted,Relevant
The ends of the ribs are feathered then fitted into notches in the framework of the piano that will exactly support the arch of the crown the pianomakers use special patterns to guide these cuts in the frame,Relevant
The two soundboard bridges transfer the vibrations of the strings along their lengths to the soundboard,Irrelevant
The long bridge is crossed by treble strings and the bass strings that fan across the trebles cross the short bridge,Irrelevant
The bridges are complicated because they must parallel the grain of the soundboard closely curve with the crown and support the strings which exert a down bearing pressure on the bridges and therefore on the soundboard,Irrelevant
This pressure must be supported by the strength of the bridges and the arch of the crown or the tone of the strings will drop,Irrelevant
The bridges are made of solid blocks of wood or of laminated wood,Relevant
Hard maple is used in American made pianos and falcon wood beech is used in Europe,Irrelevant
Laminated bridges must be placed with laminations perpendicular to the soundboard or the glue layers have a damping effect,Irrelevant
The bridges are glued to the soundboard and also fastened to it with wood screws capped by soundboard buttons made of wood that act like washers and keep the screws from grinding into the board,Relevant
The bridges are notched on both sides where each string crosses so the string strikes a small part of the bridge and can vibrate easily,Relevant
Pins are inserted in the bridge and strings are threaded between the pins,Relevant
Pianos have the greatest range of any instrument and over 2 500 parts,Irrelevant
They are considered to belong to both the string family of instruments because a piano s strings produce its sounds as well as the percussion family because the sound is produced when a hammer strikes a string,Irrelevant
Piano string is made in specialized mills and consists of carbon steel wire,Irrelevant
The bass strings are also wrapped with copper windings in a process called loading the strings,Irrelevant
The windings add weight and thickness to the steel core strings so they vibrate more slowly and can be made to lengths that fit a piano of practical size without loading bass strings would have to be 30 ft 9 14 m long to produce their sounds,Irrelevant
Treble strings are short are not wound with copper but are grouped in threes to make one tone,Irrelevant
Scale sticks are used as standards for each string acting as a gauge of each kind of wire and determining how many sizes of string are needed up to 17 different diameters of wire may be used to string one piano,Irrelevant
Piano strings require special care and handling because they lie straight after they are formed cut and loaded and are never wound on rolls,Irrelevant
After the strings are strung they are held in place near the tuning pins by metal bars and special brass studs called agraffes,Relevant
Other bars position the strings properly near the hitch pins,Irrelevant
Tuning pins are made from steel wire,Relevant
The wire is cut to the proper length the ends are shaped with a die and the pins are loaded in a tumbler where rough edges are smoothed away,Relevant
The tumbler empties them into a press where swags that fit tuning hammers are formed at the tops of the pins,Relevant
Holes for the strings are drilled into the swagged ends of the pins the pins are cleaned of metal chips and oil and nickel plating is applied to the pins to keep them from rusting,Relevant
The pins are threaded to turn easily during tuning then they are subjected to controlled heating called blueing which oxidizes the outer surface of the threads of the pins where the nickel plating was removed during threading so the pins will grip the wood in the pinblock,Relevant
Special machines insert several pins at a time through the holes in the cast iron plate and into the pinblock where they are fitted in place by hand,Relevant
Keyboards key and action frames and actions are made by specialty manufacturers,Relevant
The keys balance and pivot on a set of either two or three rails that are covered with felt to prevent noise,Irrelevant
Guide pins for each key are inserted in the front or head rail and the middle or balance rail,Relevant
The keys themselves are made of lightweight wood that is cut to size and dried in kilns,Irrelevant
The keys are covered with black or white plastic although in the past ivory and ebony were used,Relevant
The plastic key covers are molded to cover a group of keys that are later cut individually,Irrelevant
Holes are drilled on the undersides to fit the guide pins,Relevant
Capstan screws are mounted on the back edges of the keyboard extending inside the piano the action will be seated on these,Relevant
The keys are now cut into 88 individuals which are sanded and polished on the sides,Relevant
The black keys are also stained black before the black caps are glued on,Relevant
The keys are rematched to the keyframe punchings resembling washers are placed over the guide pins and the keys are placed on them,Relevant
The voice of the piano depends on the quality of the hammers,Relevant
Many materials from elkskin to rubber have been used over the history of the piano but today hammers are covered with premium wool felt of precision graduated density,Irrelevant
The felt is made by specialists who begin with select wool that is carded combed folded and compressed into felt in tapered strips,Relevant
The thinnest felt is used for the treble hammers while thick felt is used for the bass,Irrelevant
The core of each hammerhead is a wood molding and an underfelt and top felt are bonded in place with resin to cover the molding,Irrelevant
The hammerheads are made in long strips of the same size then sliced into individual hammerheads by hand or automation,Irrelevant
The complete set of hammers is installed in the piano,Relevant
The sound of the piano is adjusted by a specially trained tuner called a voicer,Relevant
The key actions must respond with the same resistance,Relevant
The felt hammers are modified with a sticker or needler that retextures the hammerheads and changes the sound,Relevant
The final parts are added including the pedals and their trapwork the fall board or key cover the music rack the hinges and top lid the topstick that supports the raised lid and many other details,Relevant
All parts are carefully made so they fit tightly and do not rattle or otherwise affect the sound of the instrument,Relevant
The toilet unit is comprised of rigid lightweight sheet plastic which is formed into a box like structure and secured with nuts bolts and rivets,Irrelevant
The top sheet contains an opening for placement of the toilet tank,Irrelevant
The top sheet may not be secured with these permanent fixtures allowing for its easy removal to clean the tank,Irrelevant
A lock may be placed over the top sheet to prevent its unauthorized removal,Irrelevant
The actual toilet tank which is placed in this unit is made of the same material and shaped with a flat corrugated front wall and rounded rear wall,Irrelevant
The upper edge of the toilet tank is formed as a peripheral flange that extends outward and downward,Relevant
The toilet tank is fitted with a cover formed of two flat semi circular plastic sheets,Relevant
The lower sheet has a peripheral edge lip that extends downward the upper sheet has a front lip that extends downward and the rear lip extends upward and outward to latch onto the peripheral flange of the toilet bowl,Irrelevant
Both sheets are fitted with a central toilet opening,Relevant
A conventional toilet seat made of plastic is placed over the toilet bowl and connected to the assembly with hinges,Relevant
The seat is fitted with a pin which pushes upward against a metal wear plate which is secured to the bottom surface of the seat,Relevant
The pin extends downward through the cover and a bracket,Relevant
Under the bracket a coil spring is placed around the pin,Relevant
The upper end of the coil engages a washer fastened to the pin so that the seat maintains an upright position when not in use,Relevant
Note Not all portable toilets are flushable ,Irrelevant
Those that are not do not contain this or the following two steps in the manufacturing process but merely contain chemicals in the holding tank,Irrelevant
A piston is placed underneath the lower end of the pin and a mechanical bellows type pump is placed beneath the piston,Relevant
The pump contains a spray opening and is connected to an inlet tube which is in turn connected to a chemical supply container,Relevant
When the seat is raised the piston will activate the pump,Relevant
The toilet opening is fitted with a pair of flat plastic doors secured by hinges to bosses fastened to the bottom of the tank,Relevant
These doors are connected to the toilet seat with metal links so that they are activated when the seat is lowered and raised,Relevant
A cabana is formed with two lightweight plastic side panels a similar back panel and a front panel with a door opening,Relevant
All parts are secured with nails screws bolts and rivets,Relevant
A variation of this model uses interfitting joints so that the facility can be disassembled and reassembled for easier transportation,Irrelevant
A rounded top and a flat bottom containing a depression for the toilet tank and a drain to release moisture are secured to the structure with rivets,Relevant
A vent pipe is placed through a small opening in the roof and another small opening in the toilet holding tank,Relevant
A plastic door is fitted with an inset handle and a sliding lock that activates a vacant not vacant sign on the reverse side of the door,Relevant
The door is attached to the front panel with hinges,Relevant
When the potatoes arrive at the plant they are examined and tasted for quality,Relevant
A half dozen or so buckets are randomly filled,Relevant
Some are punched with holes in their cores so that they can be tracked through the cooking process,Relevant
The potatoes are examined for green edges and blemishes,Relevant
The pile of defective potatoes is weighed if the weight exceeds a company s preset allowance the entire truckload can be rejected,Relevant
The potatoes move along a conveyer belt to the various stages of manufacturing,Relevant
The conveyer belts are powered by gentle vibrations to keep breakage to a minimum,Irrelevant
The potatoes are loaded into a vertical helical screw conveyer which allows stones to fall to the bottom and pushes the potatoes up to a conveyer belt to the automatic peeling machine,Relevant
After they have been peeled the potatoes are washed with cold water,Relevant
The potatoes pass through a revolving impaler presser that cuts them into paper thin slices between 0 066 0 072 in 1 7 1 85 mm in thickness,Relevant
Straight blades produce regular chips while rippled blades produce ridged potato chips,Relevant
The slices fall into a second cold water wash that removes the starch released when the potatoes are cut,Relevant
Some manufacturers who market their chips as natural do not wash the starch off the potatoes,Irrelevant
If the potatoes need to be chemically treated to enhance their color it is done at this stage,Irrelevant
The potato slices are immersed in a solution that has been adjusted for pH hardness and mineral content,Relevant
The slices pass under air jets that remove excess water as they flow into 40 75 ft 12 2 23 m troughs filled with oil,Relevant
The oil temperature is kept at 350 375 F 176 6 190 5 C ,Relevant
Paddles gently push the slices along,Relevant
As the slices tumble salt is sprinkled from receptacles positioned above the trough at the rate of about 1 75 lb 0 79 kg of salt to each 100 lb 45 4 kg of chips,Relevant
Potatoes arrive daily at manufacturing plants,Irrelevant
After they are checked for quality they are stored at a constant temperature unfil they are processed into potato chips,Relevant
Some manufacturers treat the potatoes with chemicals to improve the color of the final product,Irrelevant
To make the chips potatoes are fried in either corn oil cottonseed oil or a blend of vegetable oils,Relevant
Flake salt rather than crystal salt is used to season the chips,Relevant
Potato chips that are to be flavored pass through a drum filled with the desired powdered seasonings,Relevant
At the end of the trough a wire mesh belt pulls out the hot chips,Relevant
As the chips move along the mesh conveyer belt excess oil is drained off and the chips begin to cool,Relevant
They then move under an optical sorter that picks out any burnt slices and removes them with puffs of air,Relevant
The chips are conveyed to a packaging machine with a scale,Relevant
As the pre set weight of chips is measured a metal detector checks the chips once more for any foreign matter such as metal pieces that could have come with the potatoes or been picked up in the frying process,Relevant
The bags flow down from a roll,Relevant
A central processing unit CPU code on the bag tells the machine how many chips should be released into the bag,Relevant
As the bag forms heat seals the top of the filled bag and seals the bottom of the next bag simultaneously gates open and allow the proper amount of chips to fall into the bag,Relevant
The filling process must be accomplished without letting an overabundance of air into the bag while also preventing the chips from breaking,Relevant
Many manufacturers use nitrogen to fill the space in the bags,Relevant
The sealed bags are conveyed to a collator and hand packed into cartons,Relevant
Some companies pack potato chips in I O cans of various sizes,Irrelevant
The chips flow down a chute into the cans,Relevant
Workers weigh each can make any necessary adjustments and attach a top to the can,Relevant
Propane manufacture involves separation and collection of the gas from its petroleum sources,Irrelevant
Propane and other LPGs are isolated from petrochemical mixtures in one of two waysby separation from the natural gas phase of petroleum and by refinement of crude oil,Irrelevant
Both processes begin when underground oil fields are tapped by drilling oil wells,Relevant
The gas oil hydrocarbon mixture is piped out of the well and into a gas trap which separates the stream into crude oil and wet gas which contains natural gasoline liquefied petroleum gases and natural gas,Relevant
Crude oil is heavier and sinks to the bottom of the trap it is then pumped into an oil storage tank for later refinement,Relevant
Although propane is most easily isolated from the wet gas mixture it can be produced from crude oil ,Irrelevant
Crude oil undergoes a variety of complex chemical processes including catalytic cracking crude distillation and others,Irrelevant
While the amount of propane produced by refinery processing is small compared to the amount separated from natural gas it is still important because propane produced in this manner is commonly used as a fuel for refineries or to make LPG or ethylene,Irrelevant
The wet gas comes off the top of the trap and is piped to a gasoline absorption plant where it is cooled and pumped through an absorption oil to remove the natural gasoline and liquefied petroleum gases,Relevant
The remaining dry gas about 90% methane comes off the top of the trap and is piped to towns and cities for distribution by gas utility companies,Relevant
The absorbing oil saturated with hydrocarbons is piped to a still where the hydrocarbons are boiled off,Relevant
This petroleum mixture is known as wild gasoline,Irrelevant
The clean absorbing oil is then returned to the absorber where it repeats the process The wild gasoline is pumped to stabilizer towers where the natural liquid gasoline is removed from the bottom and a mixture of liquefied petroleum gases is drawn off the top,Relevant
This mixture of LP gases which is about 10% of total gas mixture can be used as a mixture or further separated into its three partsbutane isobutane and propane about 5% of the total gas mixture ,Irrelevant
As described above propane must be carefully isolated from a complex mixture of petrochemicals which includes methane ethane ethene propene isobutane isobutene butadiene pentane and pentene to name a few,Irrelevant
If such impurities are not removed the propane or propane and butane mixture will not liquefy properly,Irrelevant
Liquefaction at appropriate temperature and pressure is critical for the gas to be economically useful,Irrelevant
The liquefied gas industry has established standardized specifications that LPG mixtures must conform to in order to be considered acceptable for use as fuel gas,Irrelevant
Standardized test methodologies for evaluating these specifications are approved and published by the American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM ,Irrelevant
For example the LPG known as commercial propane must have a maximum vapor pressure of 200 psig at 100 F 38 C and can have no more than 0 0017 ounces 0 05 ml of residual matter,Irrelevant
Furthermore the allowed amount of volatile residue is strictly limited and the gas must meet established guidelines for corrosivity to copper volatile sulfur content and moisture,Irrelevant
Other mixtures of propane and butane are commercially available which have slightly different target values,Irrelevant
These tightly held quality standards make propane an environmentally attractive fuel,Irrelevant
In fact to meet pipeline standards nearly all pollutants are removed from propane before it is allowed to enter pipelines,Irrelevant
When used in properly adjusted and maintained burners propane s emissions easily meet the standards for clean air set by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA ,Irrelevant
Their testing has proven that propane is environmentally safer than other hydrocarbon energy sources and that properly processed propane can be used as a motor fuel which is significantly cleaner than gasoline,Irrelevant
Studies have shown that compared to gasoline propane engines have as much as 45% less ozone forming potential,Irrelevant
Results of another recent EPA study show propane reduces total hydrocarbon emissions by 29% according to the new Federal Clean Air Standards,Irrelevant
Furthermore carbon monoxide emissions are 93% below the standard hydrocarbon emissions are 73% below the standard and nitrogen oxide emissions are 57% below the standard,Irrelevant
Rammed earth houses can be built in one of three basic ways,Irrelevant
Individual rammed earth bricks can be formed and used with standard building techniques in fact such bricks may be used to form the floors in a rammed earth house built with other techniques,Irrelevant
Standard rammed earth construction involves erecting wood forms and compacting the prepared soil into these molds which are removed after the walls are completed,Relevant
The rammed earth tire method is a commonly used alternative,Irrelevant
The descriptions that follow are overviews of the standard and tire methods,Irrelevant
In the tire method a row of used automobile tires is simply laid atop the concrete footing perhaps centered around steel reinforcing bars that extend out of the footing,Relevant
The tires are then filled with soil,Relevant
About 1 000 tires are used to build the walls of a 2 000 sq ft 1609 6 sq m house,Irrelevant
An inch or two 2 5 5 cm of topsoil is removed from the building site and stored so it can be replaced around the completed structure,Relevant
Organic matter such as weeds and roots are removed and may be composted for use in post construction landscaping,Relevant
After the site is cleared the outline of the house is staked out,Relevant
The soil is excavated to a depth that guarantees a level surface the excavation includes the floor area of the building as well as a 3 ft 1 m surrounding buffer zone,Relevant
A trench may be dug so that the walls will be anchored into the ground to a depth below the winter freezing line,Relevant
The foundation which is made of reinforced concrete consists of a footing that may be as narrow as the thickness of the wall or up to three times that thickness depending on the strength of the underlying soil,Irrelevant
The footing is extended above ground level to form a short stem wall that will connect the rammed earth walls to the footing,Relevant
Depending on the architectural design a slab floor may also be poured,Relevant
A variety of tests are conducted to determine the suitability of the local soil for construction material,Relevant
For example a particle determination test reveals the relative proportions of sand and silt in the sample,Irrelevant
A compaction test is performed by forming a ball of mud and dropping it from a height of 3 ft 1 m the degree to which the ball disintegrates on impact reveals its usefulness for building,Irrelevant
Other more precise tests can be performed at a geotechnical laboratory,Irrelevant
If the native soil is unsuitable or inadequate for building it can be blended with or replaced by soil from another source,Relevant
Soil may be purchased from a quarry or it might be available as refuse from a nearby construction site in which case it could be delivered free or at a minimal cost,Irrelevant
Traditionally wood forms were used to build up walls 2 ft 0 6 m at a time,Relevant
After the mold was filled with fully compacted soil it would be removed and reset to form the next section of wall,Relevant
More efficient methods now allow forms to be constructed for the entire height of the wall even more than one story ,Irrelevant
Horizontally the framework may form the complete length of wall or it may form shorter panels [e g 8 ft 2 44 m long] separated by 6 in 15 cm gaps that can be filled with reinforced concrete for enhanced structural strength,Irrelevant
Framing is a major component of the construction process in terms of both importance and time it usually takes less time to fill and compact the soil within the forms than it does to set align and remove the framework,Irrelevant
In the case of rammed earth tire construction wood forms are not used,Irrelevant
A row of used automobile tires is simply laid atop the concrete footing perhaps centered around steel reinforcing bars that extend out of the footing,Relevant
After each layer of tires has been filled and compacted another layer will be added offset by half the tire diameter from the layer below,Relevant
Traditional tampers are made of a heavy wooden block with a handle extending upward through its center,Irrelevant
A more compact version can be made from a 4 in 10 cm square steel plate welded to a section of 1 in 2 5 cm pipe,Irrelevant
A 4 6 in 10 15 cm layer of moistened soil is placed inside the form and a worker drops the tamper from a height of 12 18 in 30 46 cm ,Relevant
In fact most of the work is now done quickly with pneumatic tampers and manual devices are used only in tight spaces around electrical boxes or plumbing pipes,Irrelevant
After many repetitions with the tamper over the entire surface of the layer the noise made by the impacting tamper changes from a dull thud to a ringing sound,Irrelevant
This happens when the soil has been compacted to about half of its original volume,Irrelevant
At this point another layer of prepared soil is added and the tamping process is repeated,Relevant
When the tamping is finished the wood forms are removed,Relevant
The tamping process is different when tires are used as the framework,Irrelevant
In this case a sheet of cardboard is placed across the bottom of the hole in the tire and moistened soil is shoveled into the tire,Relevant
The dirt is packed by hand into the interior of the tire and then it is compacted by repeated blows with a sledge hammer,Relevant
Using this technique about three wheelbarrow loads 350 lb or 158 9 kg of soil can be packed into each tire,Irrelevant
Pounding the dirt causes the tire s walls to bulge interlocking the tire to the row below,Irrelevant
As additional layers are added and the wall becomes taller scaffolding must be constructed so workers have a place to stand while filling and pounding the tires,Relevant
Interior faces of walls are often finished with plaster,Relevant
If such a coating is not applied the wall should be treated with a clear penetrating sealant to prevent dust from sloughing off,Relevant
Because stone even when manmade from rammed earth is somewhat porous it may be necessary to apply sealant to weatherproof the exterior faces of the walls in certain climate areas,Relevant
Rammed earth tire walls are finished by inserting aluminum cans into gaps between the tires and filling remaining voids with adobe straw reinforced mud ,Relevant
Earth is packed against the exterior face of the wall creating a flat surface that completely conceals the tires,Relevant
Wall interiors are finished with 2 4 in 5 10 cm of plaster or stucco,Relevant
Recliners like many pieces of upholstered furniture are assembled in stages with components put together in sections,Relevant
All components are then pulled together in final assembly,Relevant
The frame including the back are constructed of planed measured shaped and assembled wood,Irrelevant
Rigid frames are put together with nuts bolts nails and or staples,Relevant
The framing is laborious work and individuals often work alone to hand construct this part of the recliner,Irrelevant
The frame is sent to a holding area where it will await further assembly,Relevant
Die making machines and electrical discharge machines make the design cuts for the metal activating mechanisms for recliners parts for the finished metal mechanism are cut from steel in stamping machines,Relevant
The metal mechanisms are then attached to the chair frame,Relevant
The frame is made out of wood often hardwoods since the chair receives much motion or weight shifting as it moves from a conventional chair to a recliner,Irrelevant
Padding of upholstered backs is a foam that may be sculpted such as polyurethane foam,Irrelevant
All hard corners of foam blocks are padded and softened by a material such as polyester batting sheets,Relevant
Foam bodies for the upholstered parts back and seat are sculpted from a rigid foam such as polyurethane by cutting slicing or shaping with saws to conform with a desired profile,Relevant
Patterns or templates for cutting the upholstery fabric are sent electronically from the product development team to the cutting departments of the various manufacturing facilities,Relevant
This computer data is programmed into the computer driven cutting machine which cuts approximately 40 layers of fabric at a time,Relevant
The cut fabric is removed from the machine sorted marked and stored for delivery to sewers,Relevant
The cut pieces of upholstery are delivered to the sewers who work on industrial grade sewing machines to stitch all pieces of the covers for the foam seats together,Relevant
The empty cushion covers are then sent to the cataloguer who stores the cushions for the upholsterer,Relevant
Next is upholstery assembly in which polyurethane foam polyester fiberfill die cut fiberboard and covers or seats are sent to the upholsterer,Irrelevant
Edges are softened by gluing padding of some sort often polyester fiberfill to the hard edges of the foam,Irrelevant
The air bubbles are sucked out of the foam bodies thus compressing them,Relevant
The foam bodies are then pushed into the sewn cushion in order to fill it out neatly,Relevant
The upholstery covers are nailed and stapled to the seats and backs,Relevant
During final assembly the backs and seats are assembled to the seat frame the activating mechanism is attached to the frame the decorative skirt is added depending on the style of the recliner and final inspection occurs,Relevant
The process of manufacturing a particular kind of thread can vary widely from the spinning of silk to the carding and processing of wool,Irrelevant
After the particular thread for ribbon has been spun dyed and treated it is rolled on bobbins,Relevant
The bobbins are placed on a ribbon loom that consists of a series of miniature looms each with its own shuttle and warp lengths of yarn sized to produce the desired width of ribbon,Relevant
The ribbon loom may weave as many as 144 pieces of fabric simultaneously,Irrelevant
Today s ribbon looms can be very elaborate and computerized to produce detailed designs like jacquards less expensively than the looms or weavers of the past,Irrelevant
The threads leading from the bobbins are guided by a series of eye hooks that hold the position of each thread and raise and lower it as the fabric is woven,Relevant
The bobbins also called cheeses control the warp and are a major difference between ribbon loom and a fabric loom which uses a warp beam to raise and lower the warp and cloth,Relevant
The bobbins may also be curved to save space on the machine,Irrelevant
The tension of the warp thread on a ribbon loom is maintained by a series of pulleys,Relevant
A rack and pinion mechanism is used to adjust the lay flatness or slope of the loom,Relevant
To produce fancy effects ingenious devices selection of fabrics and weaving techniques are used,Relevant
Threads of different colors or multiple fibers can be woven together,Irrelevant
Odd color effects can be achieved because the fibers may take dye differently,Irrelevant
The woven product emerges on rollers that carry it forward for further processing such as adding glues stiffeners or fabric treatments,Relevant
Machines equipped with pairs of rollers press and dry the treated ribbon and large reels are used to collect the treated product,Relevant
As the ribbon is wound onto spools the tension is maintained by a governor so the ribbon does not fall slack on the spools,Relevant
If the ribbon is to be printed or embossed it is then processed through a calendar that smoothes the surface to be printed and through a printing or stamping machine,Relevant
A winder then places the ribbon on spools for packaging and sale,Relevant
The preparation of sand consists of five basic processes natural decomposition extraction sorting washing and in some cases crushing,Irrelevant
The first process natural decomposition usually takes millions of years,Irrelevant
The other processes take considerably less time,Irrelevant
The processing plant is located in the immediate vicinity of the natural deposit of material to minimize the costs of transportation,Irrelevant
If the plant is located next to a sand dune or beach the plant may process only sand,Irrelevant
If it is located next to a riverbed it will usually process both sand and gravel because the two materials are often intermixed,Irrelevant
Most plants are stationary and may operate in the same location for decades,Irrelevant
Some plants are mobile and can be broken into separate components to be towed to the quarry site,Irrelevant
Mobile plants are used for remote construction projects where there are not any stationary plants nearby,Relevant
The capacity of the processing plant is measured in tons per hour output of finished product,Irrelevant
Stationary plants can produce several thousand tons per hour,Irrelevant
Mobile plants are smaller and their output is usually in the range of 50 500 tons 50 8 508 metric tons per hour,Irrelevant
In many locations an asphalt production plant or a ready mixed concrete plant operates on the same site as the sand and gravel plant,Irrelevant
In those cases much of the sand and gravel output is conveyed directly into stockpiles for the asphalt and concrete plants,Relevant
Solid rock is broken down into chunks by natural mechanical forces such as the movement of glaciers the expansion of water in cracks during freezing and the impacts of rocks falling on each other,Relevant
The chunks of rock are further broken down into grains by the chemical action of vegetation and rain combined with mechanical impacts as the progressively smaller particles are carried and worn by wind and water,Relevant
As the grains of rock are carried into waterways some are deposited along the bank while others eventually reach the sea where they may join with fragments of coral or shells to form beaches,Relevant
Wind borne sand may form dunes,Irrelevant
Extraction of sand can be as simple as scooping it up from the riverbank with a rubber tired vehicle called a front loader,Irrelevant
Some sand is excavated from under water using floating dredges,Relevant
These dredges have a long boom with a rotating cutter head to loosen the sand deposits and a suction pipe to suck up the sand,Irrelevant
If the sand is extracted with a front loader it is then dumped into a truck or train or placed onto a conveyor belt for transportation to the nearby processing plant,Relevant
If the sand is extracted from underwater with a dredge the slurry of sand and water is pumped through a pipeline to the plant,Relevant
In the processing plant the incoming material is first mixed with water if it is not already mixed as part of a slurry and is discharged through a large perforated screen in the feeder to separate out rocks lumps of clay sticks and other foreign material,Relevant
If the material is heavily bound together with clay or soil it may then pass through a blade mill which breaks it up into smaller chunks,Relevant
The material then pass through several perforated screens or plates with different hole diameters or openings to separate the particles according to size,Relevant
The screens or plates measure up to 10 ft 3 1 m wide by up to 28 ft 8 5 m long and are tilted at an angle of about 20 45 degrees from the horizontal,Irrelevant
They are vibrated to allow the trapped material on each level to work its way off the end of the screen and onto separate conveyor belts,Irrelevant
The coarsest screen with the largest holes is on top and the screens underneath have progressively smaller holes,Irrelevant
The material that comes off the coarsest screen is washed in a log washer before it is further screened,Relevant
The name for this piece of equipment comes from the early practice of putting short lengths of wood logs inside a rotating drum filled with sand and gravel to add to the scrubbing action,Irrelevant
A modern log washer consists of a slightly inclined horizontal trough with slowly rotating blades attached to a shaft that runs down the axis of the trough,Irrelevant
The blades churn through the material as it passes through the trough to strip away any remaining clay or soft soil,Relevant
The larger gravel particles are separated out and screened into different sizes while any smaller sand particles that had been attached to the gravel may be carried back and added to the flow of incoming material,Relevant
The material that comes off the intermediate screen s may be stored and blended with either the coarser gravel or the finer sand to make various aggregate mixes,Relevant
The water and material that pass through the finest screen is pumped into a horizontal sand classifying tank,Relevant
As the mixture flows from one end of the tank to the other the sand sinks to the bottom where it is trapped in a series of bins,Relevant
The larger heavier sand particles drop out first followed by the progressively smaller sand particles while the lighter silt particles are carried off in the flow of water,Relevant
The water and silt are then pumped out of the classifying tank and through a clarifier where the silt settles to the bottom and is removed,Relevant
The clear water is recirculated to the feeder to be used again,Relevant
The sand is removed from the bins in the bottom of the classifying tank with rotating dewatering screws that slowly move the sand up the inside of an inclined cylinder,Relevant
The differently sized sands are then washed again to remove any remaining silt and are transported by conveyor belts to stockpiles for storage,Relevant
Some sand is crushed to produce a specific size or shape that is not available naturally,Irrelevant
The crusher may be a rotating cone type in which the sand falls between an upper rotating cone and a lower fixed cone that are separated by a very small distance,Relevant
Any particles larger than this separation distance are crushed between the heavy metal cones and the resulting particles fall out the bottom,Relevant
A special type of steel alloyed with tungsten is produced and rolled into strips,Relevant
The thickness of the strip sets the thickness of the finished blade and is gauged by the same instruments used to measure wires,Relevant
The blades are then stamped out of the alloyed steel using stamping machines,Relevant
The overall shape of the handsaw blade narrows from handle to tip,Relevant
The best saws have a crown or curved cutting edge rather than a straight one so fewer teeth are in contact with the surface of the wood at any given time while the saw is in motion,Irrelevant
Most inexpensive handsaws are of a uniform thickness,Irrelevant
The blade is then processed according to standards for optimal use,Relevant
Depending on the type of saw different techniques may be applied,Irrelevant
The crosscut saw for instance is bevel filed,Irrelevant
The back of a handsaw is ground thinner than the toothed edge to reduce friction during use,Irrelevant
Handsaws are generally taper ground,Irrelevant
The set or adjustment of the blade s teeth is crucial to the saw s effectiveness Saw so teeth are measured with a gauge made of plate steel that analyses three teeth at a time,Irrelevant
Then they are cut and bent in altemating directions,Relevant
Too much angling away from each other however results in a saw that does not cut properly,Irrelevant
Hardening comes next,Irrelevant
The classic technique used for centuries includes hammering the blade to render it tensioned so it displays the best combination of stiffness and flexibility,Irrelevant
Many variations are possible,Irrelevant
Today professional hacksaws are hardened throughout while those intended for home use have only their teeth hardened,Irrelevant
A coating of rust protection is sprayed on the hardened saw blade,Relevant
Finally the blades are fastened to separately made injection molded handles,Relevant
Before they are sharpened and attached the two halves of a pair of scissors are known as blanks,Irrelevant
A blank may consist of a blade and a handle in one piece or it may consist of only the blade,Irrelevant
In the latter case a metal handle will be welded to the blade or a plastic handle will be attached to it,Irrelevant
Inexpensive scissors may be made from blanks formed by cold stamping,Irrelevant
In this process a sharp die in the shape of the blank is stamped into a sheet of unheated steel,Irrelevant
The die cuts through the steel to form the blank,Relevant
Blanks may also be made by molding,Irrelevant
O Molten steel is poured into a mold in the shape of the blank,Relevant
The steel cools back into a solid and the blank is removed,Relevant
Most quality scissors are made from blanks formed by drop forging,Irrelevant
Like cold stamping this process involves shaping the blanks with a die,Relevant
This die known as a drop hammer pounds into a bar of red hot steel to form the blank,Relevant
The pressure of the drop hammer also strengthens the steel,Relevant
The blanks are trimmed to the proper shape by cutting away excess metal,Relevant
A hole is drilled through the blank,Relevant
This hole will later allow two completed blades to be attached to each other,Irrelevant
The trimmed blanks are hardened by heating them then cooling them quickly in cold air water oil or another substance,Relevant
The temperature to which they are heated and the medium in which they are cooled varies depending on the type of steel from which they are made and the desired characteristics of the blade,Irrelevant
The hardened blanks are heated again and allowed to cool slowly in air,Relevant
This second heating known as tempering gives the blank a uniform hardness,Relevant
If the blades of a pair of scissors did not have uniform hardness the harder places on one blade would soon wear out the softer places on the other blade,Irrelevant
The repeated heating and cooling causes the blanks to warp,Irrelevant
They are straightened by being placed on an anvil and lightly tapped with a hammer,Irrelevant
This process is known as peening,Irrelevant
The blank is ground into a blade by applying the edge to a rapidly moving sanding belt or abrasive wheel,Relevant
The surface of the belt or wheel is covered with small particles of an abrasive substance and works in the same way as sandpaper,Relevant
The hard abrasive grinds away enough steel to form a sharp edge,Relevant
During this process the blade is cooled with water or various liquids known as cutting fluids to prevent it from heating and warping,Relevant
The sharpened blade is then polished in a similar manner using belts or wheels containing much smaller particles of abrasive,Relevant
For many scissors the handles are I 0 formed from the start as part of the blank,Irrelevant
If not they may be made of a metal alloy or from plastic,Irrelevant
If they are metal they are made in the same way as the blanks and then welded to them,Irrelevant
If they are plastic they are made by injection molding,Irrelevant
In this process molten plastic is forced under pressure into a mold in the shape of the handles,Relevant
It is allowed to cool and the mold is opened to remove the handles,Relevant
The handles contain hollow slots into which the end of the blanks can be inserted,Irrelevant
A strong adhesive is used to keep the handle firmly attached,Relevant
Two polished blades are attached to each other by a rivet or screw through the previously drilled holes,Relevant
Rivets which cannot be adjusted by the consumer are used to make less expensive scissors,Relevant
Adjustable screws are used in more costly scissors,Relevant
The scissors are adjusted to ensure that the two blades work together correctly,Relevant
They may be painted or plated with nickel or chrome to protect them from rust,Relevant
The scissors are inspected for flaws the screw or rivet is lubricated and the scissors are wrapped for shipping to consumers,Relevant
The micro encapsulation process is done in a large vat or kettle called a reactor,Irrelevant
First scented oil is added to a solution of water soluble polymer in the reactor,Relevant
At this stage the oil and water do not mix and are separate like oil and vinegar in a salad dressing,Irrelevant
Then the mixture is blended at high speed by means of a rotary blade,Relevant
This part of the process is called high shear agitation,Irrelevant
As the rotor blade mixes the oil and water the oil breaks down into very small beads or droplets,Irrelevant
After about 12 hours of agitation the beads reach the size of from 20 to 30 microns,Irrelevant
At this size the individual beads are not visible to the naked eye and their width is less than the diameter of a human hair,Irrelevant
First scented oil is added to a solution of water soluble polymer in a reactor,Relevant
Then the mixture is blended at high speed by means of a rotary blade until the beads of oil are very small,Relevant
A chemical catalyst is added and the polymer surrounds each bead of oil forming a shell,Relevant
The newly formed capsules are washed once for scratch and sniff twice for fragrance strips,Relevant
Micro encapsulated scents may be applied to paper in different ways,Irrelevant
To make scratch and sniff papers the slurry of capsules and water can be silk screened,Irrelevant
When the beads have reached the proper size the agitation is stopped and a chemical catalyst is added,Relevant
The catalyst causes the molecular weight of the polymer to increase and the polymer becomes water insoluble,Relevant
The polymer then precipitates out of the water and rains down on the oil droplets,Relevant
The precipitate forms a plastic or gelatin shell around each individual oil bead,Irrelevant
The oil beads have been encapsulated,Irrelevant
At this point the reaction is stopped,Relevant
The next step is to remove the capsules from the reactor and wash them,Irrelevant
The capsules are removed to a belt which moves them through a spray of water,Relevant
The scratch and sniff capsules are washed only once whereas perfume capsules are washed twice,Relevant
The washed capsules are then loaded into a tank and mixed with a water base,Relevant
A thick slurry is formed,Relevant
For scratch and sniff adhesives are added to the slurry,Relevant
At this point the slurry can be applied to paper using a variety of printing processes,Irrelevant
There are four basic methods of printing used with the micro encapsulated slurry,Irrelevant
It can be silk screened onto paper or applied to a pattern gluer for web offset printing,Irrelevant
Scratch and sniff is often used for stickers and these are usually produced through a type of printing known as flexo graphic printing,Irrelevant
The strips of fragrance commonly used in advertisements are produced by extrusion,Irrelevant
The fragrance is extruded onto paper in a process similar to the way adhesive is extruded onto tape,Relevant
The extrusion process is complex and requires state of the art printing equipment,Irrelevant
Usually presses capable of handling perfume strip printing have advanced computer controls,Irrelevant
To produce the fragrance strip the paper has to be pre treated with a base coat of special water based adhesive which is extruded through pumps on the printer,Relevant
Then the base coat must be dried in an oven,Relevant
After drying the slurry of micro encapsulated perfume is extruded onto the strip,Relevant
In order to make fragrance strips precut papers are pretreated with a base coat of special water based adhesive which is extruded through pumps on the printer,Relevant
Machining is only used on unique designs or with screws too small to be made any other way,Irrelevant
The machining process is exact but too time consuming wasteful and expensive,Irrelevant
The bulk of all screws are mass manufactured using the thread rolling method and that is the procedure described in further detail,Irrelevant
Wire is fed from a mechanical coil through a pre straightening machine,Relevant
The straightened wire flows directly into a machine that automatically cuts the wire at a designated length and die cuts the head of the screw blank into a preprogrammed shape,Relevant
The heading machine utilizes either an open or closed die that either requires one punch or two punches to create the screw head,Relevant
The closed or solid die creates a more accurate screw blank,Relevant
On average the cold heading machine produces 100 to 550 screw blanks per minute,Irrelevant
Once cold headed the screw blanks are automatically fed to the thread cutting dies from a vibrating hopper,Relevant
The hopper guides the screw blanks down a chute to the dies while making sure they are in the correct feed position,Relevant
The blank is then cut using one of three techniques,Relevant
In the reciprocating die two flat dies are used to cut the screw thread,Irrelevant
One die is stationary while the other moves in a reciprocating manner and the screw blank is rolled between the two,Relevant
When a centerless cylindrical die is used the screw blank is rolled between two to three round dies in order to create the finished thread,Irrelevant
The final method of thread rolling is the planetary rotary die process,Irrelevant
It holds the screw blank stationary while several die cutting machines roll around the blank,Relevant
Threads can be cut into the blank by several methods,Irrelevant
In the reciprocal method the screw blank is rolled between two dies,Relevant
In the cylindrical method it is turned in the center of several rollers,Relevant
All three methods create higher quality screws than the machine cut variety,Irrelevant
This is because the thread is not literally cut into the blank during the thread rolling process rather it is impressed into the blank,Irrelevant
Thus no metal material is lost and weakness in the metal is avoided,Relevant
The threads are also more precisely positioned,Relevant
The more productive of the thread rolling techniques is by far the planetary rotary die which creates screws at a speed of 60 to 2 000 parts per minute,Relevant
The basic part of the industrial machine is called the bit or frame and is the housing that characterizes the machine,Irrelevant
The bit is made of cast iron on a computer numerical control CNC machine that creates the casting with the appropriate holes for inserting components,Irrelevant
Manufacture of the bit requires steel castings forging using bar steel heat treating grinding and polishing to finish the frame to the specifications needed to house the components,Irrelevant
Motors are usually not supplied by the manufacturer but are added by a supplier,Irrelevant
International differences in voltage and other mechanical and electrical standards make this approach more practical,Irrelevant
Pneumatic or electronic components may be produced by the manufacturer or supplied by vendors,Irrelevant
For industrial machines these are typically made of metal rather than plastic parts,Irrelevant
Electronic components are not necessary in most industrial machines because of their single specialized functions,Irrelevant
Parts production in the factory may include a number of precisely made components of the sewing machine,Irrelevant
Gears are made of injection molded synthetics or may be specially tooled to suit the machine,Irrelevant
Drive shafts made of metal are hardened ground and tested for accuracy some parts are plated with metals and alloys for specific uses or to provide suitable surfaces,Irrelevant
The presser feet are made for particular sewing applications and can be interchangeable on the machine,Irrelevant
Appropriate grooves bevels and holes are machined into the feet for their application,Relevant
The finished presser foot is hand polished and plated with nickel,Relevant
The frame for the home sewing machine is made of injection molded aluminum,Relevant
High speed cutting tools equipped with ceramic carbide or diamond edged blades are used to drill holes and to mill cuts and recesses to house features of the machine,Irrelevant
Covers for the machines are manufactured from high impact synthetics,Relevant
They are also precision molded to fit around and protect the machine s components,Relevant
Small single parts are preassembled into modules whenever possible,Relevant
The electronic circuit boards that control the machine s many operations are produced by high speed robotics they are then subjected to a burn in period that is several hours long and are tested individually before being assembled in the machines,Relevant
All of the parts that are preassembled I join a main assembly line,Relevant
Robots move the frames from operation to operation and teams of assemblers fit the modules and components into the machine until it is complete,Relevant
The assembly teams take pride in their product and are responsible for purchasing the components assembling them and making quality control checks until the machines are completed,Irrelevant
As a final quality check every machine is tested for safety and various sewing procedures,Relevant
The home sewing machines are sent to packing where they are separately assembled by power control units that are foot operated,Relevant
A variety of accessories and instruction manuals are packed with the individual machines,Relevant
The packaged products are shipped to local distribution centers,Relevant
After a shampoo formula is developed it is tested to ensure that its qualities will minimally change over time,Irrelevant
This type of testing called stability testing is primarily used to detect physical changes in such things as color odor and thickness,Irrelevant
It can Shampoo also provide information about other changes like microbial contamination and performance differences,Irrelevant
This testing is done to ensure that the bottle of shampoo that is on the store shelves will perform just like the bottle created in the laboratory,Irrelevant
The manufacturing process can be broken down into two steps,Irrelevant
First a large batch of shampoo is made and then the batch is packaged in individual bottles,Relevant
Large batches of shampoo are made in a designated area of the manufacturing plant,Irrelevant
Here workers known as compounders follow the formula instructions to make batches that can be 3 000 gal 11 000 1 or more,Relevant
Raw materials which are typically provided in drums as large as 55 gal 200 1 or in 50 lb 23 kg bags are delivered to the compounding area via forklift trucks,Relevant
They are poured into the batch tank and thoroughly mixed,Relevant
Some raw materials such as water or the primary detergents are pumped and metered directly into the batch tank,Relevant
These materials are added simply by pressing a button on computerized controls,Irrelevant
Depending on the size and type of shampoo making a 3 000 gal 11 000 1 batch can take anywhere from one to four hours,Irrelevant
After all the ingredients are added to the batch a sample is taken to the Quality Control QC lab for testing,Relevant
Physical characteristics are checked to make sure the batch adheres to the specifications outlined in the formula instructions,Relevant
The QC group runs tests such as pH determination viscosity checks and appearance and odor evaluations,Relevant
They can also check the amount of detergent that is in the formula and whether there is enough preservative,Relevant
If the batch is found to be out of spec adjustments can be made,Irrelevant
For instance acids or bases can be added to adjust the pH or salt can be added to modify the viscosity,Irrelevant
Colors can also be adjusted by adding more dye,Irrelevant
After a batch is approved by QC it is pumped out of the main batch tank into a holding tank where it can be stored until the filling lines are ready,Relevant
From the holding tank it gets pumped into the filler which is made up of a carousel of piston filling heads,Relevant
At the start of the filling line empty bottles are put in a large bin called a hopper,Relevant
Here the bottles are physically manipulated until they are correctly oriented and standing upright,Relevant
They are then moved along a conveyor belt to the filling carousel which holds the shampoo,Relevant
The filling carousel is made up of a series of piston filling heads that are calibrated to deliver exactly the correct amount of shampoo into the bottles,Relevant
As the bottles move through this section of the filling line they are filled with shampoo,Irrelevant
From here the bottles move to the capping machine,Relevant
Much like the bin that holds the empty bottles the caps are also put in a hopper and then correctly aligned,Relevant
As the bottles move by the caps are put on and twisted tight,Relevant
After the caps are put on the bottles move to the labeling machines if necessary ,Relevant
Depending on the type of labels they can either be stuck on using adhesives or heat pressed,Irrelevant
Labels are stuck to the bottles as they pass by,Relevant
From the labeling area the bottles move to the boxing area where they are put into boxes typically a dozen at a time,Relevant
Production lines like this can move at speeds of about 200 bottles a minute or more,Irrelevant
Asphalt shingles are produced by passing the base material through a machine that successively adds the other components,Relevant
The same machine can be used to make either shingles or roll roofing,Irrelevant
A jumbo roll [6 ft 1 83 m in diameter] of either organic felt or fiberglass mat is mounted and fed into the roofing machine,Relevant
The base material first passes through a dry looper,Relevant
Matting is accumulated accordion style in this reservoir so that the machine can continue to operate when the supply roll is exhausted and a new one is mounted,Relevant
The base material passes through a pre saturation chamber where it is sprayed on one side with hot asphalt to drive out any moisture that may be present,Relevant
It then goes into a saturator tank filled with hot asphalt,Relevant
Soaking in the asphalt coats the fibers within the mat and fills the voids between them,Relevant
The matting is again formed into accordion like folds,Relevant
While the asphalt coating on the mat cools it is drawn into the felt creating an even greater degree of saturation,Relevant
Coating asphalt which has been stabilized with powdered minerals is applied to both surfaces of the mat,Relevant
The mat passes between a pair of coating rolls which are separated by an appropriate distance to ensure that the desired amount of coating asphalt is applied to the mat,Relevant
This step may be sufficient to coat fiberglass filaments and fill voids between them in this case the saturation and wet looping steps can be bypassed,Irrelevant
The mat passes between a pair of asphalt coating rolls,Relevant
After a coating of fine mineral particles is applied to the back surface of the mat which then passes through a series of rollers that embed the coating particles in the asphalt and cool the material,Relevant
The shingles are finished by cooling and cutting them to size,Relevant
Granules of ceramic coated minerals of the desired color are applied to the top surface of the asphalt coated mat,Relevant
A coating of fine particles of a mineral such as talc or mica is applied to the back surface of the mat,Relevant
The sheet of treated mat then passes through a series of rollers that embed the coating particles in the asphalt and cool the material,Irrelevant
The strip of roofing material is accumulated accordion style on a cooling looper to finish cooling,Relevant
The sheet of finished shingle material then passes into a cutting machine where it is cut from the back side into the desired size and shape,Relevant
The machine separates the shingles and stacks them in bundles,Relevant
Bundles generally contain enough shingles to roof 25 35 sq ft 7 62 10 67 sq m ,Irrelevant
The bundles of shingles are transferred to equipment that wraps them and affixes labels,Relevant
Silver was first obtained in sixteenth century Mexico by a method called the patio process,Irrelevant
It involved mixing silver ore salt copper sulphide and water,Relevant
The resultant silver chloride was then picked up by adding mercury,Relevant
This inefficient method was superseded by the von Patera process,Irrelevant
In this process ore was heated with rock salt producing silver chloride which was leached out with sodium hyposulfite,Relevant
Today there are several processes used to extract silver from ores,Irrelevant
A method called the cyanide or heap leach process has gained acceptance within the mining industry because it is a low cost way of processing lower grade silver ores,Irrelevant
However the ores used in this method must have certain characteristics the silver particles must be small the silver must react with cyanide solutions the silver ores must be relatively free of other mineral contaminants and or foreign substances that might interfere with the cyanidation process and the silver must be free from sulfide minerals,Irrelevant
The idea for cyanidation actually dates back to the eighteenth century when Spanish miners percolated acid solutions through large heaps of copper oxide ore,Irrelevant
The process developed into its present form during the late nineteenth century,Irrelevant
The cyanide process is described here,Irrelevant
Silver ore is crushed into pieces usually with 1 1 5 in 2 5 3 75 cm diameters to make the material porous,Relevant
Approximately 3 5 lb 1 4 2 3 kg of lime per ton of silver ore is added to create an alkaline environment,Relevant
SilverThe ore must be completely oxidized so the precious metal is not confined in sulfide minerals,Irrelevant
Where fines or clays exist the ore is agglomerated to create a uniform leach pile,Irrelevant
This process consists of crushing the ore adding cement mixing adding water or a cyanide solution and curing in dry air for 24 48 hours,Relevant
Broken or crushed ore is stacked on impermeable pads to eliminate the loss of the silver cyanide solution,Relevant
Pad material may be asphalt plastic rubber sheeting and or clays,Irrelevant
These pads are sloped in two directions to facilitate drainage and the collection of the solutions,Irrelevant
A solution of water and sodium cyanide is added to the ore,Relevant
Solutions are delivered to the heaps by sprinkler systems or methods of ponding including ditches injection or seepage from capillaries,Irrelevant
Silver is recovered from heap leach solutions in one of several ways,Relevant
Most common is Merrill Crowe precipitation which uses fine zinc dust to precipitate the precious metal from the solution,Irrelevant
The silver precipitate is then filtered off melted and made into bullion bars,Relevant
Other methods of recovery are activated carbon absorption where solutions are pumped through tanks or towers containing activated carbon and the addition of a sodium sulfide solution which forms a silver precipitate,Irrelevant
In another method the solution is passed through charged resin materials which attract the silver,Relevant
The recovery method is generally decided based on economic factors,Irrelevant
Silver is rarely found alone but mostly in ores which also contain lead copper gold and other metals which may be commercially valuable,Irrelevant
Silver emerges as a byproduct of processing these metals,Irrelevant
To recover silver from zinc bearing ores the Parkes process is used,Irrelevant
In this method the ore is heated until it becomes molten,Relevant
As the mixture of metals is allowed to cool a crust of zinc and silver forms on the surface,Relevant
The crust is removed and the metals undergo a distillation process to remove the zinc from the silver,Relevant
To extract silver from copper containing ores an electrolytic refining process is used,Relevant
The ore is placed in an electrolytic cell which contains a positive electrode or anode and a negative electrode or cathode in an electrolyte solution,Relevant
When electricity is passed through the solution silver with other metals accumulates as a slime at the anode while copper is deposited on the cathode,Relevant
The slimes are collected then roasted leached and smelted to remove impurities,Relevant
The metals are formed into blocks which are used as anodes in another round of electrolysis,Relevant
As electricity is sent through a solution of silver nitrate pure silver is deposited onto the cathode,Relevant
The wire is fed into the machinery by a factory worker,Relevant
The machine flattens the wire and winds it on its end,Irrelevant
While it is being wound the machine automatically cuts it to the preset length,Relevant
The nature of spring wire is such that once it has been wound it never loses that shape,Irrelevant
The curled wire is removed from the machinery by another worker who Slinky Toycrimps one end to the coil next to it,Relevant
The worker then turns the wire around and crimps the other end in the same fashion,Relevant
If the slinky toy is to have animal attachments it is placed on an additional conveyer belt traveling to a work station where the heads and tails are applied manually,Irrelevant
When the plastic emerges from the extruder it resembles a piece of warm taffy,Irrelevant
It is then mechanically wrapped and cast around a mounted spindle called a mandrel,Relevant
As the plastic hardens it takes on the curled shape of the mandrel,Irrelevant
The coiled plastic is dipped into a warm water bath to further seal it into its curled shape,Relevant
The slinky toy is sent on a conveyer belt to a worker who inserts the toy into a box that has been opened by an automatic boxing machine,Relevant
The boxed slinky toy moves back into the boxing machine which then closes the box,Relevant
Further along on the conveyer belt the box enters a shrink wrap machine which encases the box in plastic wrap,Relevant
The boxes are then loaded into display or shipping cases,Relevant
A single sofa takes up 300 to 600 hours of skilled labor to make,Irrelevant
Even small companies and individuals avail themselves of power saws and other motorized machinery yet specialized hand tools are still applied to detail work,Irrelevant
These include the regulator for stuffing the ripping tool and a type of pliers called diagonal cutters,Irrelevant
A traditional Victorian sofa purchased as part of a parlor suite by Mary Todd Lincoln after her husband s assassination,Irrelevant
After President Abraham Lincoln s assassination his wife Mary Todd Lincoln purchased an expensive parlor suite for use in her new life as a widow,Irrelevant
The suite included a sofa table two arm chairs and several side chairs and was probably manufactured by J   J W Meeks of New York,Irrelevant
Epitomizing the Victorian era the sofa represents the ultimate in mid nineteenth century comfort and decoration,Irrelevant
The technology of the time allowed for the use of coil springs giving the seat a cushion like softness that returns to its taut shape as soon as pressure is removed,Irrelevant
New technologies also gave way to the lavishly carved show wood on the back,Irrelevant
Ordinarily the almost three dimensional fruit and flowers design would split the wood however thin layers of rosewood were cross directionally glued together to form a stronger wood laminate able to withstand the carving,Irrelevant
Once glued together the entire lamination was steamed and forced to curve with the back of the sofa,Relevant
The bent plywood system would be utilized again 100 years later by Charles Eames in order to create his famous chairs,Irrelevant
They would be the stylistic antithesis of Mrs,Irrelevant
Lincoln s ornate Victorian sofa but just as chip and crack resistant,Irrelevant
The nitty gritty of assembly is where the differences between traditional craft and Sofafactory production become most obvious,Irrelevant
Classic hand tied springs for instance may give way to a mechanically attached spring grid if recent factory practice becomes the norm,Irrelevant
Such industrial reforms have sparked controversy,Irrelevant
The following breakdown is modeled after the handmade process that still defines the industry,Irrelevant
First the frame is constructed from wood that has been found clear of any defects,Relevant
The thickness of the wood should allow for the heavy tension webbing to follow,Irrelevant
If the frame is not sufficiently strong it will not bear the weight redistributed into it by the webbing whenever someone sits down,Irrelevant
Arms back or back sections seat and legs are attached,Relevant
The preferred method is with clean cut fitted double doweled glue joints reinforced with comer braces glued and also screwed into place,Irrelevant
Each major part of the sofa will have to have springs attached separately and also be padded separately,Irrelevant
Consequently they are framed out with reinforcing slats arranged around the seat section,Irrelevant
The foundation is then set for padding,Relevant
Jute a kind of burlap made in India is used as webbing,Relevant
Strips of this material are interwoven stretched across the frame and tacked down,Irrelevant
Flax twine is then used to strap the springs onto the webbing,Relevant
Two lines of twine are tacked into position and then tied around a spring back to front,Irrelevant
Another pair of lines will run side to side on each row of springs after all the springs have been lashed into position individually,Irrelevant
If heavy gauge springs are used in the front row these are further tied down with a length of wire,Irrelevant
This process is repeated for the back with special attention to the springs at the base which are treated like the front row of seat springs,Irrelevant
If the back comes in sections sometimes three for design purposes then each part is separately tied off and the twine ends tacked onto the four sided frame,Irrelevant
The same is true for any sides and arms,Irrelevant
Each part will be wrapped in its own sheet of burlap after being completely fitted with secured springs,Relevant
The burlap is cut to size for each part tacked into place initially and then tightly lashed to the springs to minimize movement,Relevant
This is to prevent the springs from wearing through the burlap over time,Irrelevant
Each part is separately padded as well with layers of burlap and horsehair or chosen synthetic material,Relevant
The padding is placed in a burlap envelope arranged on the edge of the seat pinned into place and stitched down,Relevant
As the stitching progresses the pins can be removed one by one,Relevant
This roll is then shaped according to design requirements and stitched with special needles and more twine,Relevant
After this is secured yet still pliable a layer of about 15 lb 6 81 kg Sofaof padding is distributed over the whole area of the seat extending over the roll,Relevant
The layer is basted into place with long loose stitches and covered with lighter weight burlap,Relevant
Tighter stitching divides the seat into two areas called the platform and the nose or front edge,Irrelevant
This front part is reshaped with hand stitching,Relevant
After the shaping is completed a final thicker layer of padding is added to fill in dips left by stitching in the burlap and basted like the previous layer,Relevant
A muslin sheet of covering is applied stitched into the break between the platform and nose tightened across the front edge and back across the platform its edges are tacked into place,Relevant
Anomalies in the padding are addressed before proceeding,Relevant
The arms are done next in the same basic fashion,Irrelevant
Layers of padding and burlap are fixed in succession and topped with muslin,Relevant
The arms also have a front edge of extra thick padding,Irrelevant
Once the arms are properly shaped the back or back sections may be padded,Irrelevant
If there is more than one part to the back the center is padded first up until the second burlap layer,Irrelevant
Then the two flanking sections are padded up to that point to match the center in size,Relevant
The edge roll is formed around the top and back of the crest rail or uppermost part of the frame or the corresponding area of each of the back parts each of which must be kept parallel to the others,Relevant
After inspecting and making any adjustment to the padding the exposed wood parts can be stained and finished to taste or design specifications,Irrelevant
Every piece and panel that will be fabric covered must be measured and recorded in a cutting list,Irrelevant
The fabric is purchased in one piece or lot,Irrelevant
The panels are then plotted out in chalk so they match wherever their seams will meet when finally applied,Irrelevant
If any of the panels and pieces need to be sewn together before being attached to the padded frame this is taken care of first,Irrelevant
The seat is covered with panels for the platform and nose and hand stitched into place along the break between them over a layer of cotton batting,Relevant
The nose is then covered first to check if the pattern continues along the front properly,Relevant
The covering is fitted over the back or platform end and secured,Relevant
The arms are covered next after being prepped with their own layers of cotton batting,Relevant
A fan pleated arm is a classic look,Irrelevant
The fabric is folded into place around the front roll in a series of pleats that look like an opened fan when finished,Irrelevant
A series of strategically placed cuts may be made so the fabric clears all obstructions presented by the frame,Irrelevant
The top bottom back and pleated front are operated on in succession,Irrelevant
Temporary tacks are replaced one by one with permanent tacks,Irrelevant
Other parts to be covered like the back or its sections may require machine sewing and the attachment of pull tabs that will allow the fabric to be stretched between frame slats and secured,Irrelevant
Cotton batting is layered on as well and the appropriate panel of fabric laid down basted stretched fully into place and fixed with tacks,Irrelevant
The outside is the last part to be padded and covered starting at the arms,Irrelevant
The open area is covered with a layer of burlap an outside cotton padding and finally the finishing fabric,Relevant
Covering is fabric stitched on top and tacked into place on the bottom front and back,Irrelevant
The largest panel left open is the outside back,Irrelevant
If the webbing has left any gaps between frame slats these must be stuffed,Irrelevant
Padding should be basted over the gaps along the whole outside back,Irrelevant
The fabric panel for this section may be welted or edged with a decorative strip made of stuffing cord covered in matching fabric,Irrelevant
The covering is basted then sewn at the top and tacked at the bottom as with the other parts,Relevant
After the sofa is flipped and covered at the base with a cambric dust cover finishing touches are then applied,Relevant
The sofa may be fitted with one of several choices of skirt,Irrelevant
Arms may be supplied with welted panel covers,Irrelevant
Cushions are made separately to cover the seat,Relevant
These are constructed most often from a jacket of ticking encasing two pads that in turn frame an inner core of foam,Irrelevant
Each one is covered with finishing fabric panels supplied with a back zipper so the case can be removed for dry cleaning,Relevant
Flat plate collectors are installed on either a pitched roof or vertical walls by installing shallow sheet metal manifold pans which resemble large baking pans at each end of the collectors and fastening the pans to the rafters of the roof or wall,Relevant
Caulking is then applied liberally around the upper edge of the manifold pans,Relevant
Sheathing is next attached to the roof or wall and all seams are caulked,Relevant
Manifold slots are cut in the sheathing and blocking is fastened around the perimeter of the sheathing,Relevant
The absorber plate is installed over the sheathing extending to the outer manifold blocking,Relevant
The ends are sealed with end closure strips typically made of rubber and caulking,Relevant
The top and bottom edges are also caulked,Relevant
Battens are fastened to the absorber O plate and a glazing system consisting of a single layer of glass on a roof or a double layer of glass on a wall is attached,Relevant
Aluminum glazing bars are installed around the perimeter of the collector,Relevant
In a passive system the air handling system consists solely of ductwork installed between the collector and the living space as well as a fan and a manual control to activate the fan,Irrelevant
An isolated gain system would also include a separate storage chamber and ductwork leading to and from the chamber,Irrelevant
In an active system a storage bin holding rocks or water is required to store excess heat,Irrelevant
Ductwork with on off dampers are installed running from the collector to the house the collector to the storage bin and the storage bin to the house,Irrelevant
Two fans are installed,Relevant
A rock storage system is constructed of an insulated bin filled with small rocks 1 5 in 2 5 12 7 cm in width,Relevant
Sufficient space is allowed between the rocks to facilitate the blowing of air through the duct connections at either end of the bin,Irrelevant
A water storage system is similar to the rock storage system using water rather than rocks,Irrelevant
Brewing the traditional method of making soy sauce consists of three steps koji making brine fermentation and refinement,Irrelevant
Carefully selected soybeans and wheat are crushed and blended together under controlled conditions,Relevant
Water is added to the mixture which is boiled until the grains are thoroughly cooked and softened,Relevant
The mash as it is known is allowed to cool to about 80 F 27 C before a proprietary seed mold Aspergillus is added,Relevant
The mixture is allowed to mature for three days in large perforated vats through which air is circulated,Relevant
This resulting culture of soy wheat and mold is known as koji,Irrelevant
The koji is transferred to fermentation tanks where it is mixed with water and salt to produce a mash called moromi,Relevant
Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are then added to promote further fermentation,Relevant
The moromi must ferment for several months during which time the soy and wheat paste turns into a semi liquid reddish brown mature mash,Irrelevant
This fermentation process creates over 200 different flavor compounds,Irrelevant
After approximately six months of moromi fermentation the raw soy sauce is separated from the cake of wheat and soy residue by pressing it through layers of filtration cloth,Relevant
The liquid that emerges is then pasteurized,Relevant
The pasteurization process serves two purposes,Irrelevant
It helps prolong the shelf life of the finished product and it forms additional aromatic and flavor compounds,Irrelevant
Finally the liquid is bottled as soy sauce,Relevant
Instead of fermenting many modern manufactures artificially break down the soy proteins by a chemical process known as hydrolysis because it is much faster,Irrelevant
Hydrolysis takes a few days as compared to several months for brewing ,Irrelevant
In this method soybeans are boiled in hydrochloric acid for 15 20 hours to remove the amino acids,Relevant
When the maximum amount has been removed the mixture is cooled to stop the hydrolytic reaction,Relevant
The amino acid liquid is neutralized with sodium carbonate pressed through a filter mixed with active carbon and purified through filtration,Relevant
This solution is known as hydrolyzed vegetable protein,Irrelevant
Caramel color corn syrup and salt are added to this protein mixture to obtain the appropriate color and flavor,Relevant
The mixture is then refined and packaged,Relevant
Sauces produced by the chemical method are harsher and do not have as desirable a taste profile as those produced in the traditional brewed manner,Irrelevant
The difference in taste occurs because the acid hydrolysis used in the non brewed method tends to be more complete than its fermentation counterpart,Irrelevant
This means that almost all the proteins in the non brewed soy sauce are converted into amino acids while in the brewed product more of the amino acids stay together as peptides providing a different flavor,Irrelevant
The brewed product also has alcohols esters and other compounds which contribute a different aroma and feel in the mouth,Irrelevant
In addition to the brewed method and the non brewed method there is also a semi brewed method in which hydrolyzed soy proteins are partially fermented with a wheat mixture,Irrelevant
This method is said to produce higher quality sauces than can be produced from straight hydrolysis,Irrelevant
Typically beaver rabbit and wild hare pelts are used,Relevant
They are cleaned to remove grease and other impurities,Relevant
An acid solution is applied to the fur which prepares it for the felting process,Relevant
This procedure is known as carroting,Irrelevant
The skins are then fed through a cutting machine fur side down and the skin is cut from the fur,Relevant
The fur is then sorted by feeding it through blowing and picking machines,Relevant
Next the fur is bagged in 5 lb 2 27 kg increments and baled for shipment to the rough body plant,Relevant
Felt mixing and initial shaping 6 First the fur must be weighed out and the three types combined to the company s specifications for the appropriate mix,Relevant
The fur is cleaned and then placed in a giant bin and mixed into a fine blend,Relevant
Next the fur is forwarded into a feeder where it is broken down into an even softer blend,Relevant
From the feeder the fur is forwarded into a blowing machine and upon exit from the machine bad fibers are manually removed from the mix,Relevant
Next the mixture is placed on a conveyer which presses the mixture out into long sheets,Relevant
These sheets are then blown onto a large dome shaped prototype known as a former dome which sets the initial body of the hat,Relevant
The dome spins around rapidly for approximately 30 seconds gathering the fur much in the same way a spinner wraps cotton candy,Relevant
The former dome is placed in hot water for 35 seconds to mold the fur fibers into place,Relevant
Through a series of applications of hot water pressure and rolling known as starting and stumping the dome shaped figure is dipped in hot water and twisted,Relevant
The hat is then placed in a hardening machine four times,Relevant
Over the course of these two steps the hat begins to shrink from its original size of almost 2 ft 61 cm ,Relevant
The hat bodies are then dyed with various pigments to create a range of colors,Relevant
Blocking or shaping is performed by a three person team,Relevant
First a tipper stretches the crown of the hat,Relevant
Next a brimmer forms the band line and brim,Relevant
A blocker then sets the shape of the hat and applies a stiffening substance,Relevant
The hat is then turned inside out and hung to dry overnight,Relevant
The next day the hat is sandpapered to remove any surface hair that was not eliminated in the blowing process,Relevant
This procedure is known as pouncing and the overall operation is technically known as the back shop,Irrelevant
The two ply or two cord band is stitched around the outer bottom of the crown of the hat where it meets the brim,Irrelevant
The hat is steamed and an appropriately sized wooden block is pressed in the crown for shaping,Relevant
The crown of the hat is then ironed and the brim is plated,Relevant
The hat is then placed on a crown pouncing machine which uses very fine sand paper to remove any excess fur and finish the hat,Relevant
Powder is applied to make the hat softer and the color richer this step is eliminated for dark colored hats ,Relevant
The hat is again placed in the pouncing machine,Relevant
The shape of the brim is set and dry heat is applied,Relevant
The brim is then pressed to maintain its shape,Relevant
Excess plastic wire known as polyreed is cut off the leather sweat band to make it lay flat,Relevant
The band is hand fitted inside the hat,Relevant
Any excess leather is cut off,Relevant
The band is stitched and then tacked or glued,Relevant
The hat is cleaned brushed and steamed,Relevant
The final cutting of the brim is executed,Relevant
A bow is stitched to the outer two ply or two cord hatband,Relevant
The hat is hand creased,Relevant
A satin name pad is pressed and steamed inside the crown,Relevant
If eyelets are required they are placed in the crown at this point,Irrelevant
A cleaning instructions tag is glued to the crown,Relevant
Colorant can be added to lenses in two primary ways either by adding color to the molten lens material before the lens is formed or by chemically post coating the finished lens to achieve the desired hue,Irrelevant
In the former method the colorant additives are incorporated into the lens while the plastic or glass is at high temperatures and still liquefied,Irrelevant
Soluble organic dyes or metallic oxide pigments are added to plastic,Relevant
Metallic oxide or metal particles are incorporated into glass,Relevant
After the appropriate additives have been blended in the molten plastic or glass is then cast into the general lens shape or puck,Relevant
Inexpensive lenses are simple pucks that placed into frames,Relevant
Expensive lenses are prepared in a manner similar to the method by which prescription lenses are made,Irrelevant
First the appropriate lens puck is placed in a lensometer an instrument that is used to find the optical center of the blank,Relevant
The lens is then put in a curve generator which grinds out the back of the lens according to the patient s prescription,Relevant
An edge grinder then grinds the outer rim to its proper shape and puts a bevel on the edge allowing the lens to fit properly into the frames,Relevant
Lenses may now be coated with an anti reflective material,Relevant
The post coating method produces lenses that are more evenly coated regardless of the lens configuration,Irrelevant
It also allows for the coating to be removed and recoated after the lens is made,Relevant
Such coating may be applied through a vacuum coating method used to deposit an antireflective layer on the lens surface to reduce internal reflections,Irrelevant
This faint bluish coating is also commonly used on camera lenses and binoculars,Irrelevant
The finished lenses are now ready to be mounted in eyeglass frames,Relevant
Frames are constructed to hold the lenses in place using either a tension mount or screw mount design,Relevant
Tension mounting is typically used in plastic frames,Irrelevant
In this type of frame the dimensions of the lens opening on the front surface of the frame are somewhat smaller than the lens itself,Irrelevant
In this way the lenses can be pressed into their respective openings through the front edge of the frame without falling out its rear edge,Irrelevant
A groove is formed in the periphery of each of the openings and these mate with a ridge formed on the periphery of the respective left and right lenses,Relevant
The plastic frame material permits sufficient stretching or elongation to allow the lenses to snap into these grooves,Irrelevant
Metal frames use a screw mount design because metal tends to deform easily and cannot hold the lenses as well,Relevant
The metal structure of the frames has thin extruded sections that are bent into desired shapes,Relevant
The frame structure surrounding the lens openings forms an open loop into which the lens is inserted,Irrelevant
After the lens is inserted the loop is closed by attaching a screw to the two open ends,Relevant
First the ends of the ceramic or metal tube must be fitted with conductive metal material such as copper,Relevant
This is known as metallization,Irrelevant
Next brazing washers are attached to the metallized ends of the tube,Relevant
Thin walled hollow electrodes with radial flanges for connecting with the washers are then inserted into either end of the tube,Relevant
The assembly is then heated to braze the components and the interior of the tube is evacuated,Relevant
The tube may also be lined with getter material to absorb any undesired gases in the interior of the tube,Irrelevant
First the circuit board is metallized a circuit is traced with copper foil copper deposition or another highly conductive material,Relevant
Next slots for the resistors and capacitors are etched into the metallized circuit board,Relevant
The MOVs toroidal chokes and capacitors are soldered to the circuit board,Relevant
Outlets and an on off switch are attached and the unit is screwed into a plastic or metal casing with openings for the outlets and the switch,Relevant
There are many manufacturers of hypodermic needles and while each one uses a slightly different process for production the basic steps remain the same including needle formation plastic component molding piece assembly packaging labeling and shipping,Irrelevant
The needle is produced from steel which is first heated until it is molten and then drawn through a die designed to meet the size requirements of the needle,Irrelevant
As it moves along the production line the steel is further formed and rolled into a continuous hollow wire,Irrelevant
The wire is appropriately cut to form the needle,Relevant
Some needles are significantly more complex and are produced directly from a die casting,Irrelevant
Other metal components on the needle are also produced in this manner,Irrelevant
Diagram of a hypodermic syringe,Irrelevant
Retraction of the plunger creates the vacuum to draw up materials which can then be discharged by pushing on the plunger,Relevant
Its rubber head makes an airtight seal against the walls of the barrel,Relevant
There are various ways that the syringe tube can be fashioned depending on the design needed and the raw materials used,Irrelevant
One method of production is extrusion molding,Irrelevant
The plastic or glass is supplied as granules or powder and is fed into a large hopper,Irrelevant
The extrusion process involves a large spiral screw which forces the material through a heated chamber and makes it a thick flowing mass,Relevant
It is then forced through a die producing a continuous tube that is cooled and cut,Relevant
For pieces that have more complex shapes like the ends the plunger or the safety caps injection molding is used,Relevant
In this process the plastic is heated converting it into a liquid,Relevant
It is then forcibly injected into a mold that is the inverse of the desired shape,Relevant
Although the head of the plunger is rubber it can also be manufactured by injection molding,Relevant
Later the head of the plunger is attached to the plunger handle,Relevant
When all of the component pieces are available final assembly can occur,Irrelevant
As the tubes travel down a conveyor the plunger is inserted and held into place,Relevant
The ends that cap the tube are affixed,Relevant
Graduation markings may also be printed on the main tube body at this point in the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
The machines that print these markings are specially calibrated to ensure they print measurements on accurately,Relevant
Depending on the design the needle can also be attached at this time along with the safety cap,Irrelevant
After all of the components are in place and printing is complete the hypodermic syringes are put into appropriate packaging,Relevant
Since sterility of the device is imperative steps are taken to ensure they are free from disease causing agents,Irrelevant
They are typically packaged individually in airtight plastic,Relevant
Groups of syringes are packed into boxes stacked on pallets and shipped to distributors,Relevant
After the design is accepted it is transferred to a blueprint from which paper patterns are made,Relevant
The shapes are cut out and pinned to fabric,Relevant
Many layers of plush may be stacked with the pattern pinned on the top and a cutter with a blade much like a band saw is used to cut out many pieces at one time,Relevant
Rows of workers sit behind industrial sewing machines,Irrelevant
Each is responsible for one style of bear,Irrelevant
He or she will assemble the small pieces first add the eyes and grommet attachments to the face and then stitch the parts together,Relevant
The bears are inside out with their seams exposed and openings down the long seam in the back,Relevant
Finally the bears are pulled right side out and dispatched to be stuffed,Relevant
The volume a worker produces depends on the type of bear one may produce 35 to 45 baby bears in one day or eight or nine larger species,Relevant
The stitched bear is then stuffed,Relevant
The manufacturer purchases polyester fiber in 500 lb 227 kg bales in which the fiber is tightly packed,Relevant
The fiber is dual density with a very fine fiber and a thicker slightly wavy fiber together these fibers have the most desirable packing quality for stuffing animals,Irrelevant
Because the polyester comes so tightly packed batches of it are tossed into a picker which is a barrel lined with spikes that fluffs the stuffing,Irrelevant
The fluffed material is blown by air into a stuffing machine,Relevant
These machines have evolved little since World War H when the machines were used to stuff flight jackets for the United States Navy and Army Air Force,Irrelevant
Air pressure blows the stuffing into the bear through a small diameter tube,Relevant
The operator can manipulate the bear to direct the stuffing to various parts of the toy,Irrelevant
A pedal release on the stuffing machine controls the puffs of stuffing,Irrelevant
Two pushes on the pedal for example may be needed to pump enough stuffing from the machine s nozzle into the nose of the bear which needs to be firm,Irrelevant
The head feet and paws also need to be firm but the body should be squeezably soft,Irrelevant
The operator can always apply the hug test to evaluate satisfactory cuddliness and provide quality control from bear to bear,Irrelevant
The stuffed bear is then passed to another worker a bear surgeon who stitches up the opening in the back of the bear,Relevant
The whole bear is then groomed,Relevant
Because the plush fabric was stitched inside out fur is caught in the seams and must be pulled out so the seams do not show,Irrelevant
An electrically powered wire brush is used to fluff the seams and the bear is then blown through an array of air jets to remove the loose fuzz and brush the fur,Relevant
Final details like costumes ribbons and accessories are added before the bear is packaged for transport and sale,Relevant
Almost all television housings are made of plastic by the process of injection molding in which precision molds are made and liquid plastic is injected under high pressure to fill the molds,Irrelevant
The pieces are released from the molds trimmed and cleaned,Relevant
They are then assembled to complete the housing,Relevant
The molds are designed so that brackets and supports for the various components are part of the housing,Relevant
The television picture tube or cathode ray tube CRT is made of precision glass that is shaped to have a slightly curved plate at the front or screen,Relevant
It may also have a dark tint added to the face plate glass either during production of the glass or by application directly to the inside of the screen,Irrelevant
Darker face plates produce improved picture contrast,Irrelevant
When the tube is manufactured a water suspension of phosphor Television chemicals is allowed to settle on the inside of the face plate and this coating is then overlaid with a thin film of aluminum that lets electrons pass through,Relevant
The aluminum serves as a mirror to prevent light from bouncing back into the tube,Irrelevant
Glass for picture tubes is supplied by a limited number of manufacturers in Japan and Germany,Relevant
Quantities of the quality of glass needed for picture tubes are limited and the emergence of large screen sets has created a shortage in this portion of the industry,Irrelevant
The large screens are also very heavy so flat panel displays using plasma addressed liquid crystal PALC displays were developed in the 1980s,Irrelevant
This gas plasma technology uses electrodes to excite layers of neon or magnesium oxide so they release ultraviolet radiation that activates the phosphor on the back of the television screen,Irrelevant
Because the gas is trapped in a thin layer the screen can also be thin and lightweight,Irrelevant
Projection TVs use digital micro mirror devices DMDs to project their pictures,Relevant
A shadow mask with 200 000 holes lies immediately behind the phosphor screen the holes are precisely machined to align the colors emitted by three electron beams,Relevant
Today s best picture tubes have shadow masks that are manufactured from a nickel iron alloy called Invar lesser quality sets have masks of iron,Irrelevant
The alloy allows the tube to operate at a higher temperature without distorting the picture and higher temperatures allow brighter pictures,Relevant
Rare earth elements have also been added to the phosphor coating inside the tube to improve brightness,Relevant
The electrons are fired by three tubular metal electron guns that are carefully seated in the neck or narrow end of the tube,Relevant
The small opening at the rear of the tube is sealed with a fitted electrical plug that will be positioned near the back of the set,Relevant
A deflection yoke consisting of several electromagnetic coils is fitted around the outside of the neck of the picture tube,Relevant
The coils cause pulses of high voltage to direct the scanning electron beams in the proper direction and speed,Relevant
The housing also contains fittings for speakers wiring and other parts of the audio system,Relevant
The speakers are usually made by a specialized manufacturer to the specifications of the television manufacturer so they are assembled in the set as components or a subassembly,Relevant
Electronic sound controls and integrated circuitry are assembled in panels in the set as it travels along the assembly line,Relevant
The electrons are fired by three tubular metal electron guns seated in the neck or narrow end of the picture tube,Relevant
After the electron guns are placed inside the tube the picture tube is evacuated to a near vacuum so air does not interfere with the movement of the electrons,Relevant
A color selection filter with 200 000 holes lies immediately behind the television screen the holes are precisely machined to align the colors emitted by three electron beams,Relevant
When the picture tube and the audio speakers and attachments are assembled in the set other electronic elements are added to the rear of the set,Relevant
The antennae cable jacks other input and output jacks the electronics for receiving remote control signals and other devices are prepared by specialty contractors or as subassemblies else where on the assembly line,Relevant
They are then mounted in the set and the housing is closed,Relevant
Most rackets sold in the United States are mass produced at one of several large factories in Japan or elsewhere in Asia,Irrelevant
So regardless of the brand chances are the racket was made by one of the methods described below,Irrelevant
Rackets with unusual features might be exceptions,Irrelevant
Also top of the line rackets are often sold unstrung and the buyer has it strung to his or her specifications at a pro shop,Irrelevant
So in this case the stringing step at the factory would be skipped,Irrelevant
There are two methods for forming aluminum rackets,Irrelevant
The aluminum may be melted and forced through a die in the shape of the racket frame,Irrelevant
Or the metal may first be melted and extruded into a tube and then the tubing drawn through a die,Irrelevant
The rough racket is then placed in a drilling machine and holes are drilled for the yokethe throat piece that holds the bottom of the stringson the sides for the strings and at the base of the stick,Relevant
The drilling machine uses multiple spindles each holding a drill bit in position for each string hole,Relevant
The racket is held in place horizontally in the center of the machine,Relevant
The drills are then activated and all the holes are drilled simultaneously,Relevant
The frames are then placed in a sander to smooth out sharp edges left from the drilling,Relevant
At this stage the rackets are O tempered that is subjected to heat and rapid cooling,Irrelevant
This process hardens the aluminum giving the racket additional strength,Relevant
The rackets are placed on a tray in an oven and heated to white hot,Relevant
Then the tray is removed from the oven and the rackets are immersed in water,Relevant
After tempering the rackets may also be anodized,Relevant
They are immersed in a mild sulfuric acid solution and an electric current is passed through the bath,Relevant
This treatment changes the surface of the aluminum and gives the rackets a shiny finish,Relevant
A grommet strip is inlaid in the groove around the edge of the head,Relevant
The flexible grommet strip usually plastic has been predrilled so that its holes fit over the string holes in the frame head,Relevant
Then the yoke is fitted into the base of the racket head,Relevant
Now the racket is ready for stringing,Relevant
Each racket is strung individually by a worker seated at a stringing machine,Relevant
The worker first clamps the racket into the machine which holds it horizontally,Relevant
The worker forces the strings through the holes using a powerful threader mounted on a movable bar above the racket,Relevant
The length wise strings are pulled through first then Tennis Racket the cross strings are woven through and the tension is adjusted,Relevant
To finish the racket a worker cuts the end of the handle and inserts a cap called the butt cap,Relevant
Next the worker wraps strong double stick tape around the handle followed by vinyl grip tape,Relevant
After this the strings may be imprinted with a logo and the frame may be stamped with a decal,Irrelevant
Inspectors check the racket for nicks and mars and make sure it conforms to size and weight specifications,Relevant
Rackets may then go through a final cleaning stage,Irrelevant
Then workers place them in protective covers the rackets are packaged and finally sent to a warehouse for distribution,Relevant
Composite rackets are made out of layers of different materials usually graphite and fiberglass and perhaps other layers containing boron kevlar or a material similar to fiberglass that contains ceramic particles,Relevant
The racket manufacturer begins by assembling the layers as a flat sandwich,Relevant
The sandwich is then cut into strips and the strips rolled around a hollow flexible tube,Relevant
The wrapped tube is then placed into a racket shaped mold,Relevant
The tube extends all the way through the racket and is connected to a pump,Relevant
Then the mold is heated and air pumped into the tube,Relevant
The pressure of the air in the tube along with the heat bond the layers of the sandwich,Relevant
Alternately the hollow tube may be filled with polyurethene foam,Irrelevant
The foam expands as the mold is heated consolidating the materials,Relevant
Workers release the rackets from the molds and carry them to an inspection area where any defective ones are removed,Relevant
The end of the frame is cut and then the rackets are placed in a drilling machine and the string holes are drilled as above,Relevant
After drilling the rackets are brushed with a polymer coating and placed in a dryer,Relevant
This step is repeated several times and then the rackets are sanded,Relevant
Before the final coating the brand name decal is applied,Relevant
The next steps are the same as for the aluminum racket previously described,Relevant
A grommet strip and yoke are fixed in the appropriate grooves and workers string the rackets one at a time on stringing machines,Relevant
A logo or brand name may be screen printed on the strings,Irrelevant
Workers insert the butt cap then wind double stick tape and grip tape around the handle,Relevant
Then the rackets are cleaned inspected packaged and sent to a warehouse,Relevant
A variety of specialized equipment is used to press the pulp mixture or furnish into a nonwoven sheet of fabric like paper,Irrelevant
Nonwoven fabrics are different from traditional fabrics because of the way they are made,Irrelevant
Traditional fabrics are made by weaving fibers together to create an interlocking network of fiber loops,Irrelevant
Nonwovens are assembled by mechanically chemically or thermally interlocking the fibers,Relevant
There are two primary methods of assembling nonwovens the wet laid process and the dry laid process,Irrelevant
The wet laid process is employed for making the type of nonwoven used in tissue production,Relevant
The slurry flows into a device known as a headbox which in turn spreads it on a moving wire mesh known as a Fourdrinier,Relevant
The Fourdrinier is a continuous wire belt approximately 50 feet 15 m or more in length which is stretched out like a table,Irrelevant
As the fibers are travel down this belt much of the water drains through the holes in the wire mesh,Irrelevant
The wet sheet of fibers is carried by a series of woolen blankets called felts between several sets of rolls which further compress it and remove more water,Relevant
At this point the sheet is strong enough to be transferred to a drying machine that is especially adapted for making tissue papers,Irrelevant
The tissue paper drier is called a Yankee Dryer and consists of a steam heated highly polished roller 10 12 feet 3 4 m in diameter,Irrelevant
The wet sheet is carried by a heavy canvas felt which is threaded over and around the rollers,Relevant
With each successive pass the rollers remove more water until the paper is adequately dried,Relevant
If desired a pattern may be imprinted in the tissue by juxtaposing the web on an array of supports during the dewatering process,Irrelevant
Alternately the web can be dewatered and transferred to a separate imprinting line ,Irrelevant
The raised supports on the line create bumps and valleys on the fabric,Relevant
These are regions of varying fiber density and are visible as tiny patterned pillows on the final sheet,Irrelevant
If necessary these high bulk areas can be densified even further by applying a vacuum to selected portions of the sheet,Irrelevant
After the fabric been compressed to the desired thickness it is referred to as a web,Irrelevant
The web is now ready for additional processing,Relevant
It may be coated or stored on large vertical rollers known as calendar stacks to await further operations,Relevant
The lotion is prepared in steam heated batch tanks equipped with high speed mixing blades,Relevant
The oils and water may be preheated and are blended together with high shear to form an emulsion,Relevant
The completed lotion is ready to be applied to the paper surface and is pumped from the batch tanks to a holding vessel connected to the coating equipment,Relevant
The nonwoven web is fed onto a series of papermaking belts,Relevant
As it travels over the belts the web comes into contact with an emulsion distributing roller which pulls lotion out of the holding tank and coats a thin film onto the web,Relevant
Ideally low amounts of lotion are applied 0 3% or less to prevent the web from being overcoated,Relevant
However higher levels can be used if the coating is designed with additional surfactants that will act as wetting agents to help the tissue absorb moisture through its hydrophobic layer,Irrelevant
After passing through the coating rollers the web continues along the belts to other rollers which strip excess lotion from the fabric,Relevant
In between processes the belts are kept clean by belt cleaning showers that remove paper fibers adhesives and other additives,Relevant
The web passes through a series of rotating knives that cut it to the desired width,Relevant
The coated tissue is then sliced at tissue sized intervals folded and packaged in boxes or cellophane wrap,Relevant
After transporting the raw materials into the factory the ingredients are both manually and mechanically weighed,Relevant
This ensures accuracy in the ingredients proportions,Relevant
Then the ingredients are mixed together,Relevant
Usually the glycerin water mixture is done first,Relevant
All the ingredients are mixed together in the mixing vat,Relevant
The temperature and humidity of vat are watched closely,Relevant
This is important to ensuring that the mix comes together correctly,Relevant
A commonly used vat in the toothpaste industry mixes a batch that is the equivalent of 10 000 four ounce 118 ml tubes,Relevant
Before tubes are filled with toothpaste the tube itself passes under a blower and a vacuum to ensure cleanliness,Relevant
Dust and particles are blown out in this step,Relevant
The tube is capped and the opposite end is opened so the filling machine can load the paste,Relevant
After the ingredients are mixed together the tubes are filled by the filling machine,Relevant
To make sure the tube is aligned correctly an optical device rotates the tube,Relevant
Then the tube is filled by a descending pump,Relevant
After it is filled the end is sealed or crimped closed,Relevant
The tube also gets a code stamped on it indicating where and when it was manufactured,Relevant
After tubes are filled they are inserted into open paperboard boxes,Relevant
Some companies do this by hand,Irrelevant
The boxes are cased and shipped to warehouses and stores,Relevant
Most trampolines intended for home use are packed to be assembled by the consumer ,Irrelevant
Therefore this section will describe the process of fabricating individual components,Irrelevant
When the tubing arrives at the trampoline factory it is bent into an arc on the bending jig,Relevant
Holes are punched into the sides for the springs,Relevant
Sockets are welded so that the U shaped legs can fit into the frame,Relevant
The tubing often comes in four pieces,Relevant
When connected all four create a circular design,Relevant
One end of each arc is swagedsqueezed downso that the pieces can be put together,Relevant
Once delivered to the factory the fabric for the jumping mat is cut to size,Relevant
Using industrial sewing machines the fabric is edged and reinforced web strapping is sewn on,Relevant
D rings are also sewed into the fabric to hold the mat to the frame,Relevant
Around the foam core of the safety pads a vinyl cover and pie straps are sewn to increase durability,Relevant
The springs do not require any additional manufacturing processes at the factory,Irrelevant
They are packaged along with the other parts for final shipment,Relevant
It takes about 80 people working an eight hour shift in the trampoline factory to make 500 to 600 trampolines,Irrelevant
A vitamin manufacturer purchases raw vitamins and other ingredients from distributors,Relevant
Raw vitamins from a reputable distributor arrive with a Certificate of Analysis stating what the vitamins are and how potent they are,Relevant
In many cases the manufacturer will nevertheless test the raw materials or send samples to an independent laboratory for analysis,Irrelevant
If herbs are to be an ingredient in the vitamin capsule these must be tested for identity and potency and for possible bacterial contamination as well,Irrelevant
Often the raw vitamins arrive at the manufacturer in a fine powder and they need no preliminary processing,Irrelevant
However if the ingredients are not finely granulated they will be run through a mill and ground,Irrelevant
Some vitamins may be pre blended with a filler ingredient such as microcrystalline cellulose or malto dextrin because this produces a more even granule which aids further processing steps,Irrelevant
Laboratory technicians may run test batches when working with new ingredients and determine if pre blending is necessary,Irrelevant
For vitamin tablets particle size is extremely important in determining how well the formula will run through the tabletting machine,Irrelevant
In some cases the raw vitamins arrive from the distributor milled to the appropriate size for tabletting,Irrelevant
In other cases a wet granulation step is necessary,Irrelevant
In wet granulation the fine vitamin powder is mixed with a variety of cellulose particles Vitamin then wetted,Relevant
The mixture is then dried in a dryer,Relevant
After drying the formula may be in chunks as large as a dime,Irrelevant
These chunks are sized by being run through a mill,Relevant
The mill forces the chunks through a small hole of the desired diameter of the granule,Relevant
These granules can then be weighed and mixed,Irrelevant
When all the vitamin ingredients are ready a worker takes them to the weigh station and weighs them out on a scale,Relevant
The required weights for each ingredient in the batch are listed on a formula batch record,Relevant
After weighing the worker dumps all the ingredients into a mixer,Relevant
The volume of a typical mixer may be from 15 30 cu ft 0 42 0 84 cu m though in a large manufacturing facility it may be many times that large,Irrelevant
The ingredients spend from 15 to 30 minutes in the mixer,Relevant
At this point samples are taken from different sides of the mixer and checked in the laboratory,Relevant
The lab technicians verify that all the ingredients are distributed in the same proportion throughout the mix,Relevant
If the manufacturer is making a large batch workers may check the first three or four lots in the mixer and then only re check periodically,Irrelevant
After mixing is complete workers take the vitamin formula to either an encapsulating or a tablet making machine,Relevant
If the lot in the mixer has been approved workers tote the mixture to the encapsulating machine and dump it in a hopper,Relevant
At the beginning of a batch workers will test run the encapsulating machine and check that the capsules are the proper and consistent weight,Relevant
Workers also check the capsules visually to see if they seem to be splitting or dimpling,Relevant
If the test batches run correctly workers run the entire batch,Relevant
The vitamin mixture flows through one hopper and another hopper holds whole gelatin capsules,Relevant
The capsules are broken into halves by the machine,Relevant
The bottom half of the capsule falls through a funnel into a rotating dosing dish,Relevant
Then the machine measures a precise amount of the powdered vitamin mixture into each open capsule half,Relevant
Tamping pins push the powder down,Relevant
Then the top halves of the capsules are pushed down onto the filled bottoms,Relevant
The finished vitamin mixture can be compressed into tablets sometimes with a coating or encapsulated in preformed gelatin capsules,Relevant
The filled vitamin capsules are next run through a polishing machine,Relevant
The vitamins are circulated on a belt through a series of soft brushes,Relevant
Any excess dust or vitamin powder is removed from the exterior of the capsules by the brushes,Relevant
The polished capsules are then poured onto an inspection table,Relevant
The inspection table has a belt of rotating rods,Relevant
The vitamins fall in the grooves between the rods and the vitamins rotate as the rods turn,Relevant
Thus all sides of the vitamin are visible for the inspector to see,Relevant
The inspector removes any capsules that are too long split dimpled or otherwise imperfect,Relevant
The vitamins that pass inspection are then taken over to the packaging area,Relevant
Vitamin tablets are made in a tableting machine,Relevant
After the vitamin blend has been mixed in the mixer workers dump it into a hopper above the machine,Relevant
The vitamin powder then flows through the hopper to a filling station beneath and flows from there to a rotating table,Relevant
The rotating table may be 2 4 ft 0 6 1 2m in diameter or even bigger and is fitted with holes on its outside edge that hold dies in the shape of the desired tablet oval round animal etc ,Irrelevant
The dies are interchangeable so the same table can produce whatever shape the manufacturer wishes as long as the proper dies are installed,Irrelevant
The vitamin powder flows from the filling station to fill the die,Relevant
When the table rotates the filled die moves into a punch press,Relevant
When the upper and lower halves of the punch meet 4 10 tons 3 6 9 metric tons of pressure is exerted on the vitamin powder,Relevant
The pressure compresses the vitamin powder into a compact tablet,Relevant
The punch releases and the lower punch lifts to eject the tablet,Relevant
Some tableting machines may have two punches one on each side so two tablets are made simultaneously,Irrelevant
The speed of the rotation of the table determines how many tablets are made per minute,Relevant
The tablets eject onto a vibrating belt which vibrates any loose dust off the tablets,Relevant
The tablets then are moved to the coating area,Relevant
Vitamin tablets are usually coated for a variety of reasons,Relevant
The coating may make the tablet easier to swallow,Irrelevant
It may mask an unpleasant taste and it may give the tablet a pleasant color,Irrelevant
A manufacturer may coat in two different colors tablets that are the same size and shape for identification,Irrelevant
Tablets may also be given an enteric coatinga pH sensitive chemical coating that resists gastric acid,Irrelevant
Tablets with an enteric coating will not break open in the stomach but move to the intestine before dissolving,Relevant
Other coatings determine the timing of the tablet s dissolution so the vitamins can be absorbed slowly or all at once depending on what is appropriate to that tablet,Irrelevant
Once the tablets are taken from the tableting area they are placed in the coating pan,Relevant
The coating pan is a large rotating pan surrounded by one to six spray guns operated by pumps,Relevant
As the tablets revolve in the pan the pumps spray coating over them,Relevant
Many tablets also receive a second coating of carnauba wax,Relevant
After air drying the tablets are ready for packaging,Relevant
The packaging step is the same for tablets as for capsules,Relevant
Packaging the vitamins takes several steps and different machines carry out these steps,Relevant
So in the packaging area the vitamins pass through a row of machines,Relevant
Once the vitamins are dumped in the hopper of the first machine no human touches them,Relevant
The worker sets the machine to count out the required number of capsules or tablets per bottle and the rest is done automatically,Relevant
The capsules or tablets fall into a bottle and the bottle is passed to the next machine to be sealed capped labelled and shrink wrapped,Relevant
The finished bottles are then set in boxes and are ready for distribution,Relevant
Ground wood sheets of paper are produced by using an entire tree removing the bark and pressing the tree against a revolving tread which grinds the wood into slurry,Relevant
The slurry is used to make a ground wood sheeta relatively inexpensive wall paper backing,Relevant
Wood pulp sheets are made by debarking a tree and chipping the tree into a slurry,Relevant
The mixture is run through a pulp mill where chlorine dioxide and oxygen are added to separate the lignin which cements the woody cell walls together from the rest of the wood pulp and bleaches the pulp,Relevant
Wood pulp sheets with fibers can have synthetic fibers added to give the paper additional texture,Irrelevant
A roll of paper from the paper mill is 65 in 1 65 m wide possibly as long as 22 000 ft 6 706 m and weighs approximately one ton,Irrelevant
Once sold to a printer each paper roll is cut into six sub rolls which are 21 in 53 cm wide by 10 000 ft 3 048 m long,Relevant
Before the pattern is printed the backing must be coated with a ground color,Irrelevant
Ground wood sheets are coated with colored vinyl PVC which varies in thickness depending on the durability and strippability of paper under production,Relevant
Vinyl may also be laminated to backings for exceptional serviceability,Irrelevant
Wood pulp sheets are coated with one or all of the following kaolin clay for drapability titanium dioxide for opacity and latex for ease in handling and color,Relevant
Metal rollers impregnated with a raised rubber pattern are mounted on a single machine,Relevant
Ink is applied to the surface roller and the ink lays in the hills or rubber pattern sitting above the surface of the roller,Relevant
The ink is then pressed onto the paper,Relevant
Each color of the pattern is printed with a single roller,Relevant
Copper cylinders are laser etched then chrome plated for durability,Relevant
Large gravure printing machines hold a maximum of 12 cylinders that together create the whole pattern,Irrelevant
The paper roll moves to one cylinder a back roller picks up color and pushes it against an engraved roller,Relevant
A steel doctor blade pushes against the engraved cylinder forcing ink into the etched detail,Relevant
A rubber roller then presses paper against the cylinder enabling it to pick up the ink in the valleys of the engraving,Relevant
Finally rollers carry the paper away from the cylinder into a dryer where the ink is set,Relevant
Once the ink is dry the process begins again with the next cylinder,Irrelevant
Stencils for each color present in the pattern are created from silk mesh screen using a photographic process,Relevant
First a photographic negative is made of the pattern,Relevant
Then a silk screen approximately 36 in 91 cm long is stretched taut over a magnesium or wood frame,Relevant
The screen is coated with a light sensitive emulsion and the negative is placed on top of the screen,Relevant
Once hit with bright light the emulsion hardens in the areas not covered by the negative forming a stencil,Relevant
Patterns can be printed onto wall paper by one of several printing methods including gravure printing rotary printing and silk screen printing,Irrelevant
Paper is set upon a long table a screen stencil is placed on top and ink is applied by a scraper or squeegee,Relevant
Color is deposited on the paper where the screen permits the ink to pass through to the paper,Relevant
The stencil is picked up moved down the paper and inked again along the entire length of the paper roll,Relevant
Before the next color is applied the ink is thoroughly dried,Relevant
Each screen is carefully put down with blocks guides etc,Relevant
so that the pattern is aligned and repeats without breaks,Relevant
Hand printing produces patterns with thick evenly applied color,Relevant
Theoretically the number of colors used in the screening process is limitless however the high cost of hand printing necessarily limits the number of colors companies can include in the pattern,Irrelevant
This type of printing process combines the mechanics of gravure printing with the precision of photographically produced stencils,Irrelevant
Mesh stencils are wrapped around hollow tubes mounted within a machine,Relevant
Ink continuously flows through the film wrapped tubes and onto paper imparting a tremendous amount of color a maximum of 12 colors ,Relevant
This technique resembles the more expensive silk screening but it can print much more quicklyapproximately 80 yd 73 12 m of wallpaper per minute,Irrelevant
Printed wallpaper is rolled with a wet cornstarch or wheat starch based coating and then dried,Relevant
Residential use wallpapers are cut down from 3 000 yd 2 742 m rolls to 15 yd 13 71 m rolls,Relevant
Commercial use rolls are generally packaged in 30 45 and 60 yd 27 41 and 55 m rolls,Relevant
A printed label run number and hanging instructions are placed against each roll and shrink wrapped together,Relevant
Rolls are stored in a warehouse until final shipment,Relevant
The following description reflects the making of a full custom fitted hand tied human hair wig,Irrelevant
Such a wig would take four to eight weeks to make and would sell for approximately $2 000 to $4 000,Irrelevant
The wigmaker must first make sure that the individual hairs are lying in the same direction,Irrelevant
This is done by holding a small bunch of hair in the hand and rubbing the ends between the finger and thumb,Irrelevant
The tips uncut ends turn back during the rubbing while the cut ends which were closer to the hair s root lie straight,Relevant
If the hairs in the bunch are running in both directions they must be turned by sorting the root down hairs into one pile and the root up hairs into another before recombining them into a single organized bunch,Irrelevant
Very short hairs less than 3 in 7 5 cm long are separated out by drawing the bunch through a hackle wire brush that is clamped to the workbench,Relevant
After hackling the usable hairs are tied together into bundles of convenient size,Relevant
Fine string is used to tie the bundles tight enough to hold them securely but loose enough to allow the string to be shifted while washing the hair,Relevant
The hair is carefully inspected for nits louse eggs ,Relevant
If any are found they are removed by boiling the hair in an acetic acid solution and combing it through a steel toothed nitting machine,Relevant
Each bundle of hair is gently but thoroughly hand washed in a bowl of hot soapy water that contains a disinfectant,Relevant
The hair is then rinsed several times in clear water,Relevant
The bundles are carefully squeezed in a towel and allowed to dry either in open air or in an oven set at 176 212 F 80 100 C ,Relevant
Bundles of clean dry hair are again hackled to straighten them,Relevant
They are then passed through a set of drawing brushes so the wigmaker can sort them into bunches of equal length which are tied near the root end,Relevant
If desired hair can now be permanently curled or waved,Irrelevant
After the hair is wound onto curlers it is boiled in water for 15 to 60 minutes depending on the tightness desired and then dried in a warm oven for 24 hours or more,Relevant
Heads of growing hair are not uniform in color,Irrelevant
The wigmaker may prepare hair for a specific wig by blending as many as five or more slightly different shades of hair together to produce a more natural look,Relevant
In order to get the best possible fit the foundation of a custom wig is made as close as possible to the shape of the client s head,Relevant
This can be accomplished either by measuring several aspects of the head directly or by making a plaster cast of the head and using it as a model,Relevant
Six basic measurements are taken of the customer s head,Relevant
The circumference is measured a half inch 1 27 cm above the hairline at the nape of the neck above each ear and across the front of the head a half Wiginch 1 27 cm above the hairline,Relevant
For adults this measurement ranges from 19 24 in 48 61 cm ,Irrelevant
The second measurement is from the hairline at the front of the head to the hairline at the nape of the neck,Relevant
The third is taken between points just in front of each ear along the hairline at the front of the head,Relevant
The fourth goes across the crown of the head from just above one ear to just above the other,Relevant
The fifth runs straight across the back of the head from one temple to the other,Relevant
Finally the sixth measurement traces the nape of the neck,Relevant
In addition the wigmaker must note such information as any unusual shape of the head the length and location of any desired parting of the hair and the desired style of the hair on the finished wig,Irrelevant
A pattern is drawn and cut from light colored paper,Relevant
The edge of the wig s foundation is cut from fine mesh silk netting that matches the desired hair color,Relevant
This piece varies in width from two or more inches 5 cm in the front to one inch 2 5 cm in the back,Irrelevant
The crown of the foundation is cut from a coarser net made of silk cotton or nylon,Relevant
If a part is to be incorporated in the wig a strip of very fine silk net white or flesh colored is cut and inserted in the appropriate location on the foundation,Relevant
The paper pattern is carefully positioned on an appropriate size block a wooden head shaped form ,Relevant
With this paper lying under the net foundation the mesh of the net is easier to see and knotting is facilitated,Irrelevant
The pieces of the net foundation are joined together on the block by sewing them to pieces of galloon fine strong silk ribbon that matches the color of the foundation netting ,Relevant
The foundation is held in place on the block by cotton thread sewn through the galloon and laced through anchoring points steel loops hammered into the block ,Relevant
Springs sewn into the foundation at strategic locations will hold the completed Wigwig in place on the customer s head,Irrelevant
These devices 1 5 2 in 3 8 5 1 cm long are often made from steel watch springs or elastic bands and are encased in galloon,Irrelevant
Hairs are attached to the net foundation by a procedure called knotting,Irrelevant
Although various wigmakers use at least three types of knotting the single or full V knot is the most common,Irrelevant
It is similar to the knot used in making a latch hook rug,Irrelevant
Using this knot hairs 25 in 63 5 cm long must be used to make a wig with 12 in 30 5 cm long hair,Irrelevant
Different sizes of ventilating needles can be used depending on the number of hairs that are to be tied together in one knot,Irrelevant
Along parts and the front edges of the wig knots are usually made with single hairs while in the crown up to eight hairs may be knotted together,Irrelevant
A full wig requires 30 000 to 40 000 knots which take a total of about 40 hours of tying,Irrelevant
When the wig is fully ventilated i e all the hair is attached it is removed from the wooden block and mounted wrong side out on a soft block made of canvas stuffed with sawdust,Relevant
A final row of knotting is done around the edge,Relevant
The inside surface of the wig is pressed with a heated iron to secure the knots,Relevant
The completed wig is pinned to a soft block for styling,Relevant
The hair is gently dampened by combing through with a wet comb,Relevant
Curls are formed as pincurls or on rollers or cotton forms,Relevant
The wig is covered with a net and dried in a warm oven,Relevant
The curls are then unpinned and the hair is combed and styled,Relevant
A net is carefully placed over the finished style and the wig is returned to the oven to set the style,Relevant
There are three major spinning processes cotton worsted or long staple or wool,Irrelevant
Synthetic staple fibers can be made with any of these processes,Irrelevant
Since more yarn is produced with the cotton process than the other two its manufacture is described below,Irrelevant
Fibers are shipped in bales which are opened by hand or machine,Relevant
Natural fibers may require cleaning whereas synthetic fibers only require separating,Irrelevant
The picker loosens and separates the lumps of fiber and also cleans the fiber if necessary,Relevant
Blending of different staple fibers may be required for certain applications,Irrelevant
Blending may be done during formation of the lap during carding or during drawing out,Irrelevant
Quantities of each fiber are measured carefully and their proportions are consistently maintained,Relevant
The carding machine is set with hundreds of fine wires that separate the fibers and pull them into somewhat parallel form,Relevant
A thin web of fiber is formed and as it moves along it passes through a funnel shaped device that produces a ropelike strand of parallel fibers,Relevant
Blending can take place by joining laps of different fibers,Irrelevant
When a smoother finer yarn is required fibers are subjected to a further paralleling method,Relevant
A comblike device arranges fibers into parallel form with short fibers falling out of the strand,Relevant
After carding or combing the fiber mass is referred to as the sliver,Relevant
Several slivers are combined before this process,Irrelevant
A series of rollers rotating at different rates of speed elongate the sliver into a single more uniform strand that is given a small amount of twist and fed into large cans,Relevant
Carded slivers are drawn twice after carding,Relevant
Combed slivers are drawn once before combing and twice more after combing,Relevant
The sliver is fed through a machine called the roving frame where the strands of fiber are further elongated and given additional twist,Relevant
These strands are called the roving,Irrelevant
The predominant commercial systems of yarn formation are ring spinning and open end spinning,Irrelevant
In ring spinning the roving is fed from the spool through rollers,Relevant
These rollers elongate the roving which passes through the eyelet moving down and through the traveler,Relevant
The traveler moves freely around the stationary ring at 4 000 to 12 000 revolutions per minute,Relevant
The spindle turns the bobbin at a constant speed,Relevant
This turning of the bobbin and the movement of the traveler twists and winds the yarn in one operation,Relevant
Open end spinning omits the roving step,Irrelevant
Instead a sliver of fibers is fed into the spinner by a stream of air,Relevant
The sliver is delivered to a rotary beater that separates the fibers into a thin stream that is carried into the rotor by a current of air through a tube or duct and is deposited in a V shaped groove along the sides of the rotor,Relevant
As the rotor turns twist is produced,Relevant
A constant stream of new fibers enters the rotor is distributed in the groove and is removed at the end of the formed yarn,Relevant
The first yo yos manufactured in the United States were carved out of solid blocks of maple,Irrelevant
This was a time intensive but straight forward process,Irrelevant
Lumber was first dried in huge kilns,Relevant
This step is critical in the making of a wooden yo yo because wood warps and shrinks as it dries which is something that should happen before it is carved into the specific balanced shape of a yo yo,Irrelevant
Once dried the lumber was cut down to size,Relevant
It was then put on a lathe and using a master pattern to ensure the correct dimensions it was shaved with a variety of chisels into a yo yo,Relevant
The yo yo was either stained with wood stain or painted and then it was finished with clear lacquer,Relevant
Today most manufacturers of wooden yo yos still use this process except that very few make solid yo yos anymore,Irrelevant
Most drill into the wooden halves and connect them with a steel axle,Relevant
However the majority of yo yos made today are of plastic,Irrelevant
That process has nine steps,Irrelevant
Each half of a plastic yo yos is composed of two parts the outer shell and the inner disc,Irrelevant
These two pieces are snapped together and an axle joins two halves to form a yo yo,Relevant
Each half of a plastic yo yo begins as two pieces the flat inner piece that will take the axle is called the disc and the rounded outer piece is called the shell the butterfly type yo yo is opposite with a rounded disc and a flat shell,Irrelevant
It is made via the same process but on a separate assembly line ,Irrelevant
The plastic used to make the discs and shells is fed in the form of solid pellets into a huge funnel with an equally huge screw inside,Relevant
The outside of the funnel is wrapped with flexible strips called heater bands which are like narrow electric blankets for the funnel,Relevant
Each band gets progressively warmer as the funnel gets narrower and as the screw pushes the pellets toward the bottom of the funnel they become more and more liquid,Relevant
This process ensures that the pellets will melt evenly and completely which is critical to the next step,Relevant
At the bottom of the funnel the screw pushes the liquid plastic into a mold through a tube called a gate,Relevant
Inside the mold are the shapes of four discs and four shells all connected by gates,Relevant
The mold has a valve which allows hot air to be pushed out ahead of the plastic and ensures that the mold is completely Wooden yo yos are made from lumber that has been dried to ensure the finished yo yo will not change shape,Irrelevant
Wooden yo yos are made from lumber that has been dried to ensure the finished yo yo will not change shape,Irrelevant
Modern wooden models have two wooden halves that are connected by a metal axle,Irrelevant
Because the mold is completely filled and because the plastic has been entirely and evenly melted each shell and each disc will always be perfectly round and have perfectly even weight distribution,Irrelevant
Once the mold is filled it holds the plastic for 17 seconds and cools it with water filled tubes running along the outside of the mold,Relevant
Then the mold which is actually two halves clamped tightly together releases the shells and halves all connected by the plastic that filled the gates onto an assembly line to be fashioned into yo yo halves,Relevant
While the molding line is making yo yo halves a separate machine is cutting the axles to connect them,Relevant
The machine is fed long pieces of round metal,Relevant
The exact length of metal to make an axle is fed into a clamp where it is cut,Relevant
The cut piece is then notched at each end so that it will grip the plastic,Relevant
Once the mold releases the flat of shells and discs a worker clips them apart removes any extra plastic and snaps them together to make halves,Relevant
Each shell and disc has a lip that fits into its complimentary piece,Irrelevant
When the plastic is still slightly warm from the mold these lips will snap together,Relevant
Once fastened they will not release,Irrelevant
The halves are sent down a belt to a machine called the hot stamper,Relevant
The hot stamper has a circular tray with cup like holders around its edge,Irrelevant
Each holder takes a yo yo half and rotates it to a heated press,Relevant
The press feeds a roll of whatever logo the yo yo will display onto the top of the yo yo half,Relevant
It then presses the logo onto the half and heats it affixing the logo,Relevant
Other designs use a round insert displaying the logo which fits into the disc and a clear shell so the insert can be seen,Irrelevant
The halves continue down the line to a worker who places an axle in one half and sets it with a mallet,Relevant
The next worker places the other half on top and sets it with a mallet,Relevant
Then the assembled yo yo is placed in an air driven press,Relevant
The press has a tray in the shape of the yo yo and a metal plate that fits between the yo yo halves,Relevant
The metal plate has a groove cut out to fit around the axle and is the exact thickness of the manufacturer s specified gap between the halves,Irrelevant
When the press fires it both permanently secures the two halves to the axle and sets the correct gap between the halves,Relevant
The finished yo yo is now placed on a table with a spool of string and a cutter at one end and an upright with several notches in it at the other,Relevant
The distance between the cutter and the upright is exactly the length of the manufacturer s desired length of string for each yo yo,Irrelevant
The string is pulled down from the spool through the notch in the upright where it is looped around the axle of the yo yo,Relevant
Then it is pulled back to the cutter cut and tied,Relevant
The yo yo is then allowed to hang from its string held by the notch in the upright to twist onto the axle,Relevant
The strung yo yo moves down the line to a machine that resembles a miniature turntable,Relevant
A worker places the yo yo on the wheel holds it down with one hand holds tension in the string with the other hand and with a foot operated switch spins the string onto the yo yo,Relevant
The most common packaging for a yo yo is called a skin card,Irrelevant
The skin card is the cardboard sheet with the product attached to it with what appears to be melted plastic wrap you see hanging on store displays,Irrelevant
To package a yo yo this way a sheet of several cards is slid under a piece of wood with holes in it corresponding to the cards below,Relevant
A yo yo is dropped through each hole onto the card,Relevant
This assures correct placement on the card,Irrelevant
The sheet then moves on rollers to a machine that feeds plastic film over the entire sheet of cards and yo yos,Relevant
The film is made from a special plastic that conforms to any shape and shrinks when heated but does not melt,Irrelevant
The machine heats the plastic which tightly seals the yo yos to the cards,Relevant
The machine then cuts the sheet into individual cards and rolls them into a basket where they are collected and boxed for shipping,Relevant

If he reject our proposal the process ends,Relevant
If he accepts our services we register his demand,Relevant
We give him an appointment,Relevant
After one week he still can refuse the demand or confirm,Irrelevant
Then he receives the command,Relevant
The process is finished,Relevant
The process begins when someone is declaring a damage for which he wants to be compensated,Relevant
For that he has several ways to state the incident,Irrelevant
The choice will impact the way the clerk will address the issue,Irrelevant
The claim management officer will firstly check if the person declaring is an actual client of Ethias,Relevant
For the application or the website channel this check will be done by the person itself,Relevant
Obviously the victim must be a client of Ethias in order to be compensated if not the process ends here by informing the victim the steps that he should follow in order to be eligible for the coverage,Relevant
In some cases when the incident is claimed by phone the clerk starts by asking the victim if he or she needs some support such as a tow truck for instance,Relevant
Then the victim will share key information with the officer of the claims management department to make the declaration,Relevant
Whether it is by phone or by mail the information is transcribed into the IT system,Relevant
If the declaration is done via the form in the application or website of Ethias the information ends up directly in the IT system,Relevant
After that the case is opened for the client and the process may continue with the case instruction and examination to see if it meets the conditions to compensate the victim,Relevant
To this end the clerk will assess if there is a matter of liability in the case or not as well as checking if the client contract covers the damage that occurred and assessing the level of damage by means of experts or by his experience,Relevant
At the same time the case handler decides which type of reservation the case should follow,Relevant
In the perspective of an actuarial reservation he informs the actuarial department by sending the case to it,Relevant
In the other perspective the clerk defines the amount to reserve by himself and sends it to the actuarial department to be approved,Relevant
The case handler sees if the coverage conditions are fulfilled that is to say that for cases of engaged liabilities the client should be considered liable otherwise it s not up to his insurance to compensate,Relevant
The other condition is that the contract should cover the damage,Relevant
In the end a notification with the outcome will be sent to the client and if these conditions are well fulfilled Ethias will compensate for the damage,Relevant
The case is finally settled or unsettled,Relevant
In order to understand the reservation process better it is necessary to clarify its purpose in the context of an insurance company reservation allows Ethias to deal with future compensation needs by means of statistical computation techniques for example someone broke his leg this year and because of that he might have complications like a need for a surgery years later,Relevant
Then his insurance will have to compensate him once again,Relevant
That s why on the insurance side they have to make a reservation in order to be prepared for these cases,Irrelevant
As seen in the claims management process the clerk decides which type of reservation is needed based on his evaluation,Relevant
Actuarial reservation only deals with cases considered as recurrent and with a higher level of generality also they are most of the time short term cases,Irrelevant
Otherwise the clerk determines and evaluates by himself the amount to reserve but still sends it to the actuarial department for approbation,Relevant
So for this process when the claim management officer informs the actuary that the case needs an actuarial reservation the latter collects all the data regarding the case by means of a database,Relevant
Then he analyzes it in order to fix new hypotheses which will be used for computation,Relevant
This computation is handled by a mathematical program,Relevant
Nevertheless to find which model to use the actuary follows precise guidelines and rules,Irrelevant
The outcome of this computation will be checked by the actuarial control 4,Relevant
If changes are needed the actuary will adjust his model and repeat the computation,Relevant
After the approbation by the actuarial control the assessment of the case is sent to the accounting department in order to be accounted for,Relevant
It s up to the actuary to communicate the reservation to the accounting department,Relevant
To initiate this process a product manager from the marketing or sales department requests to price a product,Relevant
Then the actuary team of the tarification department will gather data and statistics about the type of incidence that the service covers,Relevant
The Ethias database is filled with information in order to develop a technical model of tarification to take into account the specific risks and give a first price for the premium,Relevant
But this price does not always comply with the market demand and customer needs this is the reason why the actuary team and the product manager exchange information to compute a model more suitable for the market,Relevant
This second version of the model will be sent to the actuarial control in order to be reviewed and to check the perspective of profitability with the business plan,Relevant
When the review is done if changes are needed the actuary team takes care of remodelling it and shows the model to the actuarial control once again until it s validated by it,Relevant
This validation must be followed by the agreement of all the stakeholders that are linked with this pricing process,Relevant
Their agreement is necessary before establishing the tariff and sending it to the product manager,Irrelevant
The underwriting process begins when a demand for insurance coverage is perceived by the sales department,Relevant
This demand is sent either by a peer to peer procedure between Ethias and the organisation by a broker as an intermediate of the concerned company or by a tendering procedure on public markets,Relevant
This distinction doesn t change the process in essence but rather in the outcomes and the channel of communication,Irrelevant
Then the demand is transferred into the CRM system of Ethias either by the sales officer or in some cases automatically,Relevant
Next the sales officer checks if this demand comply with the business guidelines of Ethias in strategic or relationship terms,Relevant
Generally the case complies and continues its path towards the underwriting department to follow two successive analysis procedures first an acceptance analysis which is made in order to make the decision to keep such demand or to reject it,Relevant
If the underwriter doesn t accept it then the process ends otherwise he proceeds in a second time to a tarification analysis,Relevant
These two phases are modelled as subprocesses which consist of multiple tasks that should be done before setting the tariff and the offer,Relevant
In addition a competence scheme helps to decide whether the offer needs to be agreed by two other third parties BOL and HAC or not depending on the offer,Irrelevant
They can eventually ask for adjustment before pursuing the process,Relevant
Later on if the third parties agreed when needed the underwriter decides the channel through which he will make the offer,Relevant
Considering the circumstances he has 3 possibilities the offer could either be led directly towards the client through the CRM system be led to an account manager ACMA that will defend the offer in front of the call for tenders or be placed in a share application for the sales department that will handle it from there,Relevant
The outcome of the offer will be communicated through the same channel used to make the offer,Relevant
The last tasks for the underwriter are to settle all the paperwork and then depending on the outcome to classify the case or not if the outcome is negative he must do so if it is positive the onus is not on him to do that and the process is over,Relevant
This process begins when a client requests insurance coverage,Relevant
He has the choice to fill in the subscription form digitally or to have contact with a clerk in an agency or via phone call,Relevant
The sales officer of the front office will define what services the customer needs and check if he is already a client in Ethias,Relevant
If it s not the case the clerk affiliates him by asking for personal information,Relevant
Then the officer will check the client s incident data in DataSure which is a database to centralise all the declared incidences from any insurance company in order to decide if he is eligible for the services needed,Relevant
If he is not eligible the rejection is communicated directly after this verification,Relevant
Either way the clerk makes the first quotation with the information gathered and hands in to the client or sends it via letter or email if the request is made via phone call,Relevant
The client reviews it fills it with extra information needed to establish any contracts and sends it back via the channel of his choice,Relevant
If it is physically then the clerk decides if it meets the criteria of acceptance by analysing the risk,Relevant
The rejection is also communicated to the client after this verification,Relevant
If accepted the clerk makes changes if needed by taking into account the review of the client and the extra information,Relevant
Then the contract is printed and given to the client and waited to be signed,Relevant
If it is digitally the back office takes care of making the verification with the criteria and establishing the contract by taking into account all the data,Relevant
All this procedure is simplified if the client firstly decides to fill the subscription digitally,Relevant
For that he needs to be affiliated and this is made possible thanks to the website or the application,Irrelevant
The subscription form and client s data are sent directly to the back office to be evaluated and analysed,Relevant
The officer checks with the criteria of acceptance and decides whether to send a rejection or to establish and send the contract to be signed by the client,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is sick or absent for whatever reason,Relevant
The first step of the process has to be done by the employee he has to send his medical certificate to the human resources and at the same time he has to contact them in order to inform them of the duration of its absence,Relevant
Thanks to this the human resources can start their own process in which they try to replace him by someone,Relevant
Then after both of these tasks have been completed the next tasks will mainly concern the human resources department,Relevant
They have to sort out the different types of medical certificates check if they are certificates without pathologies or certificates with pathologies,Relevant
On the one hand if and only if the certificate is without any pathology the human resources employee has to check it and verify if the certificate is valid,Relevant
Then he has to verify some little things like the start of the absence the end of it and then he has to send a mail to SPCM to prevent them,Relevant
Following this at the same time he has to encode this absence in the system in order that all the organization can be aware of the absence of the employee and he has to notify the medical advisor too and then the medical advisor will have to choose whether the veracity of this absence must be checked or not,Relevant
On the other hand if and only if this certificate contains pathologies the human resources employee has to send it directly to the Service Provincial de contrle mdical and has to fulfill a form,Relevant
After that the SPCM checks if the certificate is correct and if there is any problem,Relevant
After that he then gives his accord to the organization to encode this,Relevant
So the human resources employee can encode this in the database,Relevant
Afterwards at the same time they have to notify the medical advisor and then the medical advisor chooses to check the veracity of this absence or not and the human resources employee can check the date the absence etc,Relevant
After that in addition they receive the acknowledgement of receipt and finally they can put the certificate in the HR certificate folder and the process is over,Relevant
The process starts at the end of the month when it is time to pay the different employees in the company,Relevant
We should note that almost the entire process is carried out by human resources,Irrelevant
Firstly at the same time the human resources employee is doing 4 different tasks which are check for extra hours check leaving request check attendance system in order to know how many hours the employee worked and then check it with the system Unitime,Relevant
Finally he checks sickness so if an employee was absent and then uses HR Accent in order to verify this,Relevant
When all these 4 steps are finally done he writes a recap with all the information so he can export them to Securex,Relevant
Securex checks the feedback and sends it to the human resources,Relevant
After receiving the feedback from Securex the human resources employee treats the document in order to make a proposal for the salary,Relevant
After receiving the proposition there is a question within the HR are we agree with this proposition? If no the process restarted at the proposition of wage slip,Relevant
If the response is yes we can continue the process,Relevant
Human resources can then send the payment permission to Securex and wait until the reception of Securex agreement,Relevant
Subsequently several things have to be done at the same time we are going to describe them branch by branch,Irrelevant
Firstly in the first branch he receives the dcompte de paye and then prints it in order to send the file to the employee,Relevant
Afterwards there is a question Is there any contestation? If there is no contestation we can continue and finalize the process with the acceptation of Securex payment,Relevant
But if there is a contestation we have to ask the CEO what to do with it and then a new process starts,Relevant
Finally on the other branch things that need to be done first are to ask Securex to prepare the invoice then we are waiting until Securex creates it and sends it,Relevant
After this there is another question Are we sending this to accounting or not? If the answer is yes we can accept Securex s payment and the process ends,Relevant
And if no once again we have to ask the CEO what to do,Relevant
This process starts when an application is sent by a candidate to the HR which do a first sorting and then a second one,Relevant
After this the first interview take place,Relevant
Then we are in the first question which is Is this a key position or not? If yes we need to know if we need complementary assessments if yes a specialist office makes a couple of tests and then sends the results to the HR,Relevant
After this we conclude whether it is okay or not,Relevant
If it is not we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that,Relevant
We therefore destroy these data,Relevant
But if it is okay we arrive to the second interview which is important,Relevant
If it is not necessary to get more assessments we can go directly to the second interview,Relevant
So at this moment we are at the same point,Irrelevant
After the interview there is a selection if the candidate is not selected then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
If it is not a key post we are directly in the step of selection,Relevant
So if the candidate is not selected then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
The process starts when the financial department picks up an invoice in order to pay it,Relevant
It should be noted that the file in question is recuperated in the ISABEL system,Relevant
Firstly the financial department employee prints the details of payment,Relevant
After this he shows the file to the financial director,Relevant
Afterwards he needs to classify the invoices according to whether they are above 150 000 euros or under 150 000 euros,Relevant
When we are under 150 000 the financial employee just has to inform the HR department,Relevant
When we are above 150 000 he has to ask the financial director to find out if it is okay,Relevant
After these steps we follow the same path in both cases and the process stays located in the financial and accounting department,Relevant
Then the employee verifies the liquidity on the account in order to know if there are no problems with the treasury,Relevant
After that he can send money to the bank account send an email to CBC bank with the details of payment and finally register the payment in the SAP system before ending with the receiving of the account statement,Relevant
This process starts when a client asks for an intervention,Relevant
This request is directly registered in a file,Relevant
Then it must be checked if the intervention is included in the contract,Relevant
If it is not the client must be asked whether he agrees with the financial part and then the client must respond to this in order for the organization to get his feedback If he doesn t agree the process stops,Relevant
But if he agrees the organization can define the costs of the intervention,Relevant
If yes the organization can define the costs,Relevant
After this at that moment we are on the same track it should be chosen if we need an internal quote or an external one,Relevant
We then arrive to 2 different questions The first one is Do we need an accord regarding the quote? If the answer is yes the approbation of the client has to be asked,Relevant
If his answer is that it is okay he must be informed about the start of the intervention,Relevant
Then the intervention is finished,Relevant
But if he refuses the quote the process ends again,Relevant
If the answer is no the client must be informed about the start of the intervention and also when it will be finished,Relevant
The process starts when a customer makes a request to open close the P1 S1 port these are ports on the smart meter that allow the customer to connect their application on which they can consult their energy consumption in real time ,Relevant
The call is received by an interlocutor called Connexio working for a defined network distribution manager in our case for ORES obviously ,Relevant
The Connexio will then control whether the customer is addressing the correct DNM using an identification database,Relevant
If it is the wrong DNM the Connexio informs the customer and the call ends,Relevant
Once the DNM check has been carried out he will proceed to a process check,Relevant
If it is a High Voltage process the customer is redirected to another service otherwise if the process is Low Voltage the Connexio identifies the requester thanks to the database of municipalities and social housing then controls the verbal offer,Relevant
If it is not a verbal offer the request is transferred to the Connection Work process,Relevant
If it is a verbal offer the process continues and the Connexio controls the file,Relevant
If the file is existing he informs the client and the process ends otherwise he communicates the price of the service to the customer and reads the GDPR disclaimer in case of an opening then waits for the client s response,Relevant
If the client accepts a file is created,Relevant
Otherwise the file is immediately closed and the process ends,Relevant
After having created the file the Connexio asks if the client is able to receive a remote operation if he is not able he asks whether the preparatory work is the client s responsibility,Relevant
If he is able is the client s request unique? If the client s request is not unique he asks if the preparatory work is the client s responsibility otherwise he asks directly what type of appointment to make,Relevant
Concerning the preparatory work if they are not the client s responsibility then the Connexio asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
But if they are the responsibility of the customer the Connexio informs the customer about the preparatory work he waits for a response if the customer does not accept the file is closed and the process ends,Relevant
If he accepts then he also asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
There are two types of appointments The first one is if remote operations work from June 2020 the Connexio sends confirmation to the customer but also to the control room that the thing has been taken into account,Relevant
The control room receives this remote operation request for opening closing port P1 S1 and the process is terminated,Relevant
The second one is if the technician has to come to the customer s house the Connexio controls the duration of the intervention he schedules an appointment if the intervention cannot be scheduled the Connexio records the non schedulable intervention request and the call ends ,Relevant
After scheduling the appointment he sends the appointment confirmation to the client waits for the appointment confirmation,Relevant
After receipt he sends the work order to the technician,Relevant
The technician receives the file and the process ends,Relevant
The process is separated in 2 lanes fieldworker and Work control OSP,Irrelevant
The process starts with the reception of a request to install a smart meter for the activation of prepayment mode,Relevant
All the processes arrive at the same gateway so I will describe each process up to the point of intersection and then explain what happens after,Relevant
1 The customer was present and another customer was present,Relevant
If the customer wants a recovery they process it to a recovery form,Relevant
If the customer doesn t want a recovery then they see if it is their first visit a 2 Another customer was not present and the customer accepts the installation,Relevant
b They check the communication network coverage,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and they wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
c After that whether there is fraud or not if there is not a smart technical impossibility they replace the meter with a smart meter,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility they send the information of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put a budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna they move the antenna to another area covered by the network and follow c ,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electromechanical technical possibility such as in c ,Relevant
Another customer was not present and the customer does not accept the installation,Relevant
If the client is electro sensitive then the process goes directly to the checking of the electromechanics technical impossibility in the c ,Relevant
If the client is not electro sensitive and it is their a first visit the process goes directly to the point of intersection,Relevant
If it is not their a first visit but it is their second visit and the meter installation is possible before shutdown then the process continues to point b ,Relevant
If the meter installation is not possible before shutdown and a meter cut is possible 2 things happen simultaneously,Relevant
The first is checking if the meter installation is possible if yes it goes to b if not it goes to the point of intersection,Relevant
The second is to send the cutout start execution request to the meter and then wait for the message of the smart meter cut back,Relevant
If there is no cancellation request they perform the cut on the meter,Relevant
d After that an effective cutoff confirmation is filed which sends a message to the customer then they send the effective cutoff information which lead to the intersection point and e in the Work control OSP lane receiving information on the execution of cuts which send an end signal of management of cut returns,Relevant
f If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point,Relevant
If a meter cut is not possible g they check the possibility of a network cut,Relevant
If a network cut is possible they send the request to start the execution of the network cut then wait for the message to start network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process arrives at f and if not they execute the cut network then follow d ,Relevant
If a network cut is not possible they send the non cut information which simultaneously lead the process to the intersection point and in h the work control OSP lane receive the information about non execution of cuts which send an end signal of post administration,Relevant
3 The customer was not present and it is the first visit,Relevant
If the meter is not accessible the process goes directly to the intersection point,Relevant
If the meter was accessible they check the communication network coverage,Relevant
i If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
j After that whether there is fraud or not if there is not a smart technical impossibility the meter is replaced with a smart meter and the process goes to the intersection,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility the information is sent of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put an electromechanics budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna the antenna is moved to another area covered by the network and follow j ,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electrical technical possibility such as in j ,Relevant
4 The customer was not present and it is not the first visit,Relevant
If it is their second visit and a meter installation is possible before shutdown they follow i ,Relevant
If it is not their second visit or it is their second visit but the meter installation is not possible before shutdown they check if a network cut is possible,Relevant
If yes they send a request to start execution of the network cut and wait for a message of network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point and if not they cut the installation file an effective cutoff notice which sends a message to the customer and send confirmation of effective shutdown which leads the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane following e ,Relevant
If the network cut is not possible the information is sent of the non execution of the cut which lead the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane following h ,Relevant
All of these lead to one gateway after that they complete the worksheet,Relevant
If the client is present they sign the worksheet and if they are not a calling card is left for the customer which sends a message to them,Relevant
Both of them lead to saving the worksheet and ending the process in the Work control OSP lane with post administration,Relevant
This process is divided into 5 lanes planned works technical solution officer supervisor manager and CTM coordinator,Irrelevant
The process starts at planned works when an appointment s planning is needed,Relevant
First thing is to know if it is a grid construction work or not,Relevant
If it is not a grid construction work planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation they find out if there is an authorization or an information request a ,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation is it an individual planning? b If it is a grid construction work that is needed the file is sent to the technical solution officer,Relevant
1 Planned works wait for the period defined in the order then check if there is a request for authorization or information,Relevant
a If it is an information request planned works show the levelling zone and encodings to Powalco and then check KLIM and CICC and the process goes on,Relevant
If it is an authorization request they check if the authorization has been received,Relevant
If it has been received the process goes on if it hasn t planned works contact the competent authorities again to receive the authorization then the process goes on,Relevant
Planned works then figure out if there s a presence of KLIM CICC,Relevant
If there is the file is sent to the CTM coordinator 2 and planned works wait for the CTM coordinator s feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received the process goes on,Relevant
* If there is not a presence of KLIM CICC planned works find out if it is an individual planning,Relevant
b If it is an individual planning the process goes on,Relevant
If it is not an individual planning they form the batches transmit a list to the contractor and inform the client and the process goes on,Relevant
c * Planned works then contact the client to arrange an appointment they make the client aware of the preparatory work and then plan the appointment with them,Relevant
They send a confirmation email to the client,Relevant
If the reply received is negative planned works contact the client again,Relevant
c If the reply is positive planned works assess if the work is planned on a contractor,Relevant
If it is planned works prepare the file that will be sent to the contractor and send it to him,Relevant
Then the process is done and a signal is sent to the process Execute the work ,Relevant
If it is not the file is sent to a technician and planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation the process is done and a signal is sent to the process Execute the work ,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation planned works send the file to the contractor to carry out civil engineering,Relevant
The process is then done and a signal is sent to the process Execute the work ,Relevant
1 When the technical solution officer gets the file they get back the file s investment cronos and check the CTM,Relevant
If there is a CTM file it is sent to the CTM coordinator 2 and the process goes on,Relevant
If there is not a CTM file the process goes on,Relevant
The technical solution officer adjusts the file d asks for authorization inform planned works of the theoretical period * ,Relevant
The officer finally transfers the file to the supervisor and his part is over,Relevant
When the supervisor gets the file he checks if the authorization is received,Relevant
If it is not received the process goes back to the officer,Relevant
d If it is received the supervisor executes the construction work foresees the end of the work and informs the manager which gets the info then sends the file to the manager and the process is done,Relevant
The manager gets the file foresees the end of the work executes the operation work informs planned works of the end of the works * and then the operation work is done,Relevant
2 The CTM coordinator gets the file contacts the other recipients visits the work site creates a report and sends the feedback to planned works,Relevant
He then informs the technician and the contractor and the CTM is managed,Relevant
The two main ORES services involved in the work execution process are the planned works department and the executing agent working in parallel,Irrelevant
Three other ORES actors play a lighter role namely the design office supervision and local logistics manager ,Irrelevant
Executing agent The process starts with the receipt of the file,Relevant
Then either civil engineering works are required or not,Relevant
If they are required the agent plans them informs the planned works of the civil engineering opening date 1 then carries out the inventory of fixtures executes the earthworks and finally confirms the execution of the earthworks to the planned works 2 ,Relevant
Otherwise nothing happens,Relevant
After that the executing agent tries to reach the client 15 minutes before his departure and then goes to his home,Relevant
If the client can be reached and is present he carries out the inventory of fixtures,Relevant
If the client is not present at first the agent tries to reach him but if he is still unreachable the executing agent then leaves a calling card calls the BOPW encodes the mobile data and finally signs the report,Relevant
The Process ends in the management of the nonexecuted,Relevant
After the inventory of fixtures the agent checks whether additional work at the client s request is necessary if not he can directly check the certificate of conformity,Relevant
If any work is required the agent looks whether he needs BOPW information,Relevant
If so he will request it and wait for confirmation,Relevant
In case of refusal he checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
In case of confirmation or if BOPW information is not required he informs the customer of the costs asks for his agreement carries out the work and finally checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
After checking the certificate of conformity he checks the power and then jointly measures the column and replaces the meter and the parameter,Relevant
In the event of a problem at the time of replacement or parameter setting the agent informs the local logistics manager 3 if the problem concerns only one meter the operation is repeated otherwise an electromechanical meter is installed then the customer is informed and the agent answers any questions in the same way as if the parameter setting was carried out correctly,Relevant
After that if the LED confirms the functionality,Relevant
Then the meter is switched on otherwise it is left switched off,Relevant
Then he draws up an inspection plan which he sends to the Ores drawing office 4 enters the connection and counting data confirms the materials used draws up the output inventory and has the customer sign the report,Relevant
If civil works are required the agent plans the closure of the civil works informs the planned works of the closure date 5 plugs up the holes repairs in a definitive manner makes the inventory of fixtures and finally confirms the completion of the repair to the planned works 6 ,Relevant
Finally his last task is to encode the internal services in the case of internal services or to encode the internal services in the case of entrepreneurial work,Relevant
The process ends by sending the file to the post administration,Relevant
Planned work The process begins with the planning of the worksite,Relevant
Then if civil engineering works are required the planned works department receives the civil engineering opening date from the executing agent 1 the department then sends the civil engineering dates to the client waits and finally receives confirmation of the earthworks by the executing agent 2 ,Relevant
If no civil engineering works are required the planned works department informs the client by sms of the date of the works 48 hours in advance,Relevant
The department then receives the execution information,Relevant
If the execution is not carried out the process ends and the prepare for execution process begins,Relevant
If it has been carried out there is a waiting period,Relevant
Finally again if civil works are required the planned works department receives the civil works closing date from the executing agent 5 the department then sends the civil works closing dates to the client waits receives the confirmation of the civil works closing from the executing agent 6 and finally updates the data in the POWALCO software,Relevant
If there is no civil engineering nothing happens,Relevant
The process is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
The drawing office The process starts with the reception of the plan from the executing agent 4 and is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
Monitoring The process starts with the reception of the date of the works then the service ensures the supervision of the building sites and the process is finished with supervised building sites,Relevant
Local logistics manager The process starts with the reception of the message from the executing agent 3 then he processes the request and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts at planned works when a technical visit is needed,Relevant
If a visit without appointment V1 is needed planned works transfer the request to a technician and waits for feedback with the info concerning the V1,Relevant
While planned work is waiting a technician gets the request carries out the visit and transfers info to planned works before being done with V1,Relevant
When planned works get the V1 info they can move on and prepare a file for a technical visit V2 ,Relevant
If a V1 is not needed planned works directly prepare a file for a technical visit,Relevant
Planned works then plan V2 with the client,Relevant
After they send a request to agents to know their availability,Relevant
When the agents get the request they process it taking into account geographical and technical skills and send back their availabilities to planned works,Relevant
After receiving the agents availability planned works confirm the appointment with the client and send the file to a technician,Relevant
They then wait for feedback while the technician gets the request carries out a technical visit and sends their feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received planned works handle it and then assess if civil engineering is required,Relevant
If it is not required the processing is done,Relevant
Otherwise the feedback is sent to the contractor and the processing is done,Relevant
The subscription process is facilitated by the digital transformation in usual context the customer and the company are engaged into an endless mail exchange demanding the documents for the subscription,Irrelevant
Thanks to Flora a new client only needs to enter some information about his property and his insurance fee is automatically calculated using the dimension and the location of his property,Relevant
If the new client is not in the defaulters database there is no need for an employee to take part in the process the contract and insurance details will be automatically digitally created and sent to the customer,Relevant
If the client is indeed in the defaulter s database Flora needs to conduct a short investigation to determine if they accept the client or not before finishing the process following the classical way,Relevant
By using this process customers are now able to modify their contract online following a move for instance by simply entering details about their new property,Irrelevant
Their new price is calculated in the same way as in the subscription process and the rest is also similar contract and insurance details will be automatically created and sent to the customers as well as the new contract start date,Irrelevant
Flora allows the customer to make this report via a chatbox within the mobile app in a few steps,Irrelevant
Of course after the declaration an external contractor will come to your place to contact the damage but there is no need to extra paperwork that is usually used with the traditional way,Relevant
The following process is of high interest as switching insurance can be really difficult and require documents and long procedures from both the former and the new insurance company,Irrelevant
Noting that this is actually a sub process of the subscription as most new clients are often covered before subscribing to Flora,Irrelevant
To complete the process customers are invited to enter different information about their former contract such as the company and their contract number,Relevant
Then the resignation form is generated and signed online by clients using Itsme Belgian Mobile ID initiative ,Relevant
The rest of the process is handled by Flora which will deal with the former insurer and will send them the resignation form,Relevant
Once these tasks are completed details about the former contract terms end date and the new contract start date are sent to customers,Relevant
At last the new contract will automatically start at the end of the former one,Relevant
By using Flora a procedure that can take several days for clients is now completed in a few minutes,Irrelevant
Filling a complaint is one of the most common processes inside an insurance company,Irrelevant
This is usually a very tedious process for the client but now thanks to the new channel of communication it is much easier for the clients using the Flora s application in order to fill a complaint this can be done in few minutes,Irrelevant
The prospection and commercial process is triggered by the sales engineers who study the requirements of the prospects potential clients,Relevant
Then the CEO COO elaborate sales strategy and set individual goals,Relevant
Sales Engineers receive requests for quotation from clients and afterwards they consider whether the project submitted by the customers is feasible for Alpha or not,Relevant
If not the request is declined and the process is stopped,Relevant
But if the quotation is feasible sales engineers work together with the help of R D engineers to make a technical and commercial offer and ask for client s agreement,Relevant
If the customer s answer is not favorable then they try to know on which point they failed to interest the customer and then the process is stopped,Relevant
But conversely if the customer s response is favorable then back office registers new client and its order in the ERP system,Relevant
The sales engineers compare the order with the quotation made at the customer price quantity product description delay and after that a contract is written by the CEO in collaboration with the sales engineer with the possibility of having some negotiations with the customers on commercial terms,Relevant
If the order is compliant with the offer made the back office checks the availability of the product and the production delay announced by the ERP system,Relevant
Otherwise the continuity of the process goes back to the steps before there are once again negotiations with the customers in order to find a common agreement ,Relevant
When these two tasks are completed the back office confirms and validates the order to the client and they register the complete order in the ERP system,Relevant
Once this last step is completed the prospection and commercial process ends,Relevant
The R D process starts when a need is expressed,Relevant
Sales engineers and R D engineers formalize the request describe the new product and evaluate the feasibility cost strategy coherence in the early stages,Relevant
Then the CEO COO challenge their analyze and decide if the feasibility is conceivable the project is stopped if it is not the case ,Relevant
Sales engineers and R D engineers check prototype scale feasibility   conduct tests,Relevant
If the project is technically validated by R D the production engineers go on by checking industrial feasibility and preparing production file,Relevant
After that step the Quality Manager certificates the product and requests client s approval by sending them the previous documents,Relevant
If the customer s feedback is good the bill of materials is made and the current process ends otherwise the engineers continue to improve the development plans and the process is repeated in the stages of carrying out tests and analyzing feasibility on a prototype scale,Relevant
The process starts when the engineers make the BOM Bill of Materials and send the file with the logistical needs defined by a color code,Relevant
Consequently a need is expressed and registered in the ERP system,Relevant
The supply chain department looks at the BOM and then decides if it needs comparative quotes,Relevant
If the purchase amount is estimated to be greater than 10000 comparative quotes are needed,Relevant
In this case the supply chain department searches suppliers consults three of them and compare their offers,Relevant
Then it chooses a supplier,Relevant
If the purchase amount is estimated to be less than 10000 the supply chain department does not need comparative quotes and directly selects a supplier,Relevant
After selecting a supplier there are two options If this is a new supplier the specific team composed by the COO the head of the supply chain department and the quality manager performs a supplier audit,Relevant
If the conclusions of this audit are not positive the supply chain department selects another supplier,Relevant
If the audit is conclusive the supply chain manager registers supplier s information in the ERP system and sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
If Alpha Innovations has already worked with this supplier the specific team sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
Afterwards the supply chain department establishes the order and receives the material once the supplier has fulfilled the order,Relevant
In some case a conformity certificate is required because AISA works with railway companies RATP for example or nuclear sector where high level of traceability is mandatory,Relevant
If a conformity certificate is required the supply chain department asks a conformity certificate to the supplier and creates its own conformity certificate this document ensures that the products are not counterfeit items before performing the qual,Relevant
In some cases the supply chain organizes quality control for incoming and finished goods and the warehouse clerk checks it,Relevant
Alpha Innovations controls most of the time the products quality except when it comes to checking small parts like basic screws etc ,Relevant
If the quality control shows material is defective the supply chain gives the order to the warehouse clerk to return the product to the supplier,Relevant
If the quality control is good the warehouse clerk stores the product and registers it in the ERP system,Relevant
Finally the head of supply chain the quality manager and the COO evaluate the supplier s performance ask for corrective actions if the supplier is not performant enough and then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the workshop manager receives the project from the R D department,Relevant
With the recommendations from the production engineer he evaluates which and how many workers must be assigned to this project linked to the difficulty s level of the latter,Relevant
With the help of the supply chain manager he checks when all the needed material BOM will be available in stock at the factory,Relevant
With all this information he gives an approximation of the delivery date to the customer,Relevant
He receives a set of documents thanks to the ERP system which describes the BOM Bill of Materials mechanical plans electrical scheme control prescription everything that is needed to organize production of the project,Relevant
The supply chain department receives the document and launches a production order to the warehouse clerk who prepares and sends all the materials needed to the workshop,Relevant
At this stage the workshop manager must prepare assembly aid documents which describe the production process adapted to the type of work to be executed,Relevant
The function of the workshop manager is also to describe the jobs of each technician involved,Relevant
Afterwards technicians operate first they prepare nameplates to be able to identify all the products and cables,Relevant
Secondly they assembly the systems while they identify themselves at each step of the process for the tracing and consequently the responsibility,Relevant
The workshop manager is responsible for describing the complexity of conformity control which is afterwards operate by the technicians,Relevant
At this stage test technicians operate the FAI First Article Inspection they inspect the finished systems to see if it is safe functional and conform to the specifications,Relevant
If all tests are conclusive the system is sent to the shipment employee who will package and send it to customers with the help of other actors haulers ,Relevant
The systems production process ends at the moment the system is submitted to the shipment employee,Relevant
The process is triggered when the product is received by the packaging employee who packages the product,Relevant
Then two tasks are done in parallel addition of a suitable ID label to the package and wedging and wrapping to protect the product,Relevant
The packaging employee makes the delivery form and send it to the head of shipment department who is going to give a pick list number and afterwards registers the pick list number on the ERP system,Relevant
Later on the packaging employee fills the picklist with the product s information weight date on the ERP system,Relevant
Subsequently the employee stores the product in the shipment area,Relevant
After that the head of shipment management received on the ERP system the picklist completed and then classify the picklist by due date until the delivery day,Relevant
When the delivery day has come the back office does two tasks at the same time to prepare the delivery note and print it and prepare the invoice and print it as well,Relevant
After that the back office sends the documents to all services concerned via the ERP system i e accounting ,Relevant
Finally the packaging employee add the waybill and the delivery note on the package and thereafter he gives the package to the haulers,Relevant
The process ends when the order is sent,Relevant
The process starts when IT equipment is needed by a service manager,Relevant
The request is first analyzed by the head of the IT Department and they have to decide if the request is justified or not,Relevant
If the request is not justified the process ends,Relevant
If the request is justified they also have to decide if they accept it or not in some cases the request is justified but the solution requested to this need seems to be inappropriate ,Relevant
If the request is not accepted but stays justified obviously the service manager has the opportunity to adapt the request and suggests a new request that the head of IT Department will analyze again and the process starts again,Relevant
The service manager has also the choice to not adapt his request and the process ends in this case,Relevant
But if the request is accepted then the head of IT department asks for a quote,Relevant
If it is the first time that the supplier works with the company the purchasing department has to add this supplier in the suppliers evaluation form,Relevant
If the budget or treasury will be affected with this expense the Chief Financial Officer has to analyze the expense and decides if he validates the expense or not,Relevant
If he does not validate it then the head of the IT Department has to ask for a new quote to a new supplier,Relevant
If the expense is validated the head of the IT Department completes the purchase form and then the purchasing department makes the order and sends it to the supplier,Relevant
When the order is ready the supplier sends it with the purchase documents that is to say the invoice and the acknowledgement of receipt to the head of the IT department who sends after all to the service manager,Relevant
Next both the head of the IT department and the purchasing department compare the purchase order with the delivery and the invoice,Relevant
If one of them finds something incorrect they contact the supplier in order to solve the problem and then compare it again and contact the supplier again until everything is in order,Relevant
When everything is correct or if everything was right the first time the Chief Financial Officer has to validate the purchase,Relevant
If he does not validate it the comparison process between the invoice the purchase order and the delivery starts again until the amount to be spent aligns with their expectations,Relevant
If he validates the purchase then he pays the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the need is notified by the receipt of a purchase order form by the service manager,Relevant
Then the purchase department has to analyse the demand if it is not ok the demand is obviously rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise they have to request a quote,Relevant
If the quote is asked to a new supplier the purchasing department has to add it into the evaluation suppliers form data base ,Relevant
Then the financial management has to validate the quote if it is not ok the demand has to be analysed again but if it is financially ok the service can be ordered so the service department asks for an intervention,Relevant
The supplier performs the requested service and sends the purchase documents purchase order and invoice afterwards,Relevant
Next the purchasing department compares the purchase order with the invoice received and has to validate if something is wrong the invoice is not validated and the department contacts the supplier for another validation,Relevant
Otherwise the financial department has to validate it a second time,Relevant
Again if it is not ok the purchase department has to compare it again but if it is ok the financial department puts the invoice in payment and the process ends when the service provider is paid,Relevant
The process starts with the presentation of the candidate at the office,Relevant
He enrolls for the examination,Relevant
The centre manager checks the planning in the license database if the candidate is already planned,Relevant
If it is not the case the centre has to create a new file for this candidate in the license database,Relevant
Then he registers the candidate to the examination,Relevant
The applicant has to pay for his registration,Relevant
If the payment is not received the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the process continues and the centre manager checks the validity of the candidate and guide s ID cards,Relevant
If those are invalid the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If on the contrary the ID cards are acceptable the centre manager checks the age conditions,Relevant
If those are not fulfilled the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the process continues and the centre checks that the ID card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If he notices a mismatch the Chief examiner seizes his ID card and warns the authorities,Relevant
The candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If it corresponds the centre checks the temporary driving license and the certificate from the municipality,Relevant
If those are invalid the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If those are valid there are 2 possibilities,Relevant
Either the applicant has learned by a driving school or by another guide,Relevant
This second case requires an additional step the centre checks the guide driving license,Relevant
If his driving license is invalid the process ends and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If it is valid the process keeps going,Relevant
This step is not necessary if the candidate has learnt by a driving school,Relevant
Next the centre checks the vehicle documents,Relevant
If those are not valid the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the process continues with the examiner who checks the vehicle state,Relevant
If he evaluates the car as defective the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
On the contrary if the vehicle is in good conditions the centre manager makes a random selection of the examination track thanks to the IT system of the company and the candidate is allowed to take the examination,Relevant
The candidate is accepted and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the centre,Relevant
An employee of the centre completes the identity verification form at least every 25 candidates and checks the validity of the client s ID card according to the regulation ,Relevant
If the ID card is not valid the process ends and the client is refused,Relevant
If it is valid the client s age is checked once again according to the legislation,Relevant
If the candidate doesn t fulfil the age requirement the process ends and he is refused,Relevant
In the case where the client fulfils the age requirement the centre employee checks that the card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If the card is not corresponding to the candidate the employee takes the ID card warns the authorities and the process ends,Relevant
The client is thus refused because of failure and fraud,Relevant
If the card corresponds to the candidate the centre employee checks the number of failures and the driving school certificate if necessary,Relevant
The employee then registers the candidate,Relevant
If a session is not available the client asks the availability and or takes an appointment then comes back to the beginning arrival ,Relevant
If a session is available he checks that the client is already in the database,Relevant
If the client isn t the centre employee creates a new file in the Database Permis DB Permis ,Relevant
If the client was already registered or has just been registered the employee registers the candidates and checks his data,Relevant
After that the client has paid the employee generates a session for the candidate according to his category from the DB Permis which generates a random series of questions,Relevant
The client takes the exam,Relevant
If a fraud is detected during the exam the centre interrupts the exam and warns the authorities the client is then refused failure and fraud and the process ends,Relevant
In each case the results are printed by the centre,Relevant
If the exam is passed the client takes the reading test and the process ends with the delivery of the provisional driving licence PCP the results and some information,Relevant
If the exam is failed the client is given the results of the exam,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the examination centre,Relevant
There is a previous control of the vehicle by the examinator before he makes a random selection for the track with the IT system,Relevant
Then he takes note of the track and manoeuvres,Relevant
The customer makes the track and manoeuvres directed by the examinator according to the traffic regulations ,Relevant
The examinator assesses the abilities of the candidate,Relevant
If he makes a dangerous manoeuvre the exam is interrupted,Relevant
Otherwise the examinator makes a global assessment of the exam and he registers the assessments with the IT system,Relevant
He encodes the results and sends them to the server of the company with the IT system and the protocol of the exam ,Relevant
Then he archives the protocol and at the same time he gives the result to the candidate,Relevant
If the result is a success the exam is passed but if it is a failure the exam is failed,Relevant
The first step in the registration process is the quote calculation,Irrelevant
It begins when someone needs to obtain a tenant insurance,Relevant
The user will then take an interest in Flora and go to the website,Relevant
The customer will go on dcouvrir mon prix and so the quote calculation process begins,Relevant
The user is now on the page where he selects the type of housing,Relevant
It can be a house 2 or 3 faces a villa 4 faces or a flat,Irrelevant
Selecting an accommodation type enables the user to move forward to the next screen,Relevant
The user just has to click on the right button to go further there is no continue button ,Relevant
Then the user has to enter his address to go further in the process,Relevant
When the user starts typing his address a drop down list appears with all the street names corresponding to the entered characters,Relevant
In order to move forward the user has to select one address in the Google results and the system moves on directly to the next page,Relevant
If the user enters an address abroad the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora is only available in Belgium,Relevant
If the user lives in a zone subject to flooding a pop up window also appears to say that the house is located in a zone subject to flooding and that the user cannot be insured for the moment the user can be redirected to the Ethias website,Relevant
If the address is unknow the message Je ne trouve pas mon adresse appears,Relevant
The user is redirected to the page where he has to enter manually his address he has to complete manually all the fields,Relevant
If the address is known located in Belgium and complete the user clicks on Confirmer and is then redirected to the monthly rental amount page,Relevant
The monthly rental amount is a mandatory field,Irrelevant
If it is left empty a warning red notice must ask the user to correctly fill it out Max of characters 7 ,Relevant
If the user enters a higher rent the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora doesn t insure properties with a rent higher than 1500,Relevant
The user can decide to move on to the Ethias website or exit the Flora s quote calculation process by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner the button Je comprends ,Relevant
The user then goes to the Prix page which mentions the price of the rental insurance for his property at his address,Relevant
The price covers the civil liability and the content of the housing,Irrelevant
The user can choose to add or not add the vandalism cover,Relevant
To finish this process the user has to tick the Checkbox of the terms conditions before being able to continue,Relevant
Once the quote calculation process is complete a customer profile must be created,Irrelevant
This process starts with the screen mon compte the user must fill in different information First name name date of birth phone number email address and password are mandatory fields,Relevant
Before going to the next step the system makes a verification about the age of the user,Relevant
In fact the user must be between eighteen and hundred years old because they consider that outside this age slice you are less likely to take out insurance,Irrelevant
So if the customer is under eighteen or over hundred the process stops and the customer gets stuck,Relevant
The next step consists in checking if the email address still exists in the system because it is possible to have a user who has given the account creation just after entering the personal information or who has left the process for a moment perhaps to pick up where he left off later on,Relevant
So if the email address did not still exist Flora will then send an email to the user in order to allow him to validate his email address,Relevant
In the email the user can push on a button Valider mon compte or on another Je n ai pas demand de compte Flora ,Relevant
If the email address still existed we can go on the next step,Relevant
After that Flora has to check if the email address is still validated,Relevant
If it is the case the account is created and it s the final event,Relevant
If the user did not confirm his email address and pushed on button Je n ai pas demand de compte Flora the process stops and no account will be created for the user,Relevant
Just in order to precise a little at the end of this business process the user is still not a customer he is a prospect,Irrelevant
He will become a customer once he will be logged into the application as such,Irrelevant
This step of the process is important because it will be impossible for the user to use the app as long as he is not a real client,Irrelevant
Indeed he will be considered as a prospective customer until the moment he makes the payment,Irrelevant
Without this payment even if the user created an account he is not allowed to gain access to the application,Irrelevant
The first stage consists in asking the client information about his moving in the housing,Relevant
On the one hand if he already moved in Flora will invite the client to state if he is insured for this housing or not,Relevant
In case of a client who is already insured Flora will ask the user to enter the contact details of his previous insurer and we will deal with the termination of his contract,Relevant
On the other hand if the user has not moved in yet the app will request him to enter the date of moving in and his future address,Relevant
After that he will be invited to choose a payment method,Relevant
The client will soon be allowed to choose among three different means of payment with a credit card via PayPal or via Apple Pay,Relevant
For the moment there are only two payment methods available the credit card and PayPal,Irrelevant
By selecting the credit card as mean of payment the user will be redirected to the next screen,Relevant
At that point he will have to encode his card number the name of the card the validity date and the CVV number,Relevant
Obviously there will be no direct debit before the start of the contract,Irrelevant
In the case where the user would want to pay with PayPal he would be redirected to the PayPal interface in order to check that the available balance on PayPal is sufficient to pay,Relevant
Then the user can click on the button Suivant which will redirect him to another screen with a summary of his contract type of housing monthly rental amount full address contract duration price credit card registered and so on,Relevant
After having checked the elements of his contract he must accept the general terms conditions before subscribing to the product and paying,Relevant
Then he can click on Confirmer and in that case it means that the user wants to confirm and pay,Relevant
Once the contract is confirmed the client will be invited to download the application in order to handle his insurance directly from the application,Relevant
From the moment he confirmed the contract is forward to him by email,Relevant
Finally at this step of the process the client receives a confirmation email with the documents related to the contract attached,Relevant
If he receives this email it means that the payment is accepted and therefore the contract is confirmed,Relevant
From a legal point of view it is mandatory to send a confirmation email to the policyholder,Irrelevant
From that moment the client can log in into his account access his profile and his documents ask questions manage decisions and request a refund in the event of a damage,Irrelevant
First of all when the client wants to create a new claim he needs to open the chat bot in the app,Relevant
The date of the damage will be requested from the customer to verify if he was covered by insurance at the time of the damage,Relevant
If this is not the case the client will not be compensated,Relevant
Then the client will receive a reduced list of the frequent damage and will be asked to select the damage concerned,Relevant
If the damage is not in this list then it may be part of the list of damages not covered and in this case the customer will not be compensated,Relevant
Or the client may request to be put in contact with the CCM customer communication management ,Relevant
However if the damage has been found on the list the process continues normally,Relevant
The client will then be asked whether or not it was a personal property,Relevant
If it is then the client will give more information about the asset,Relevant
And if it is not the process continues to the next step,Relevant
In that step the client will have the opportunity to report another claim if this is the case the client will be sent back to the beginning of the process in order to give all the necessary information again,Relevant
If there is no further damage to report then the customer will be asked for the owner s contact information,Relevant
Afterwards the application will ask the customer if there is at least one property that belongs to the owner,Relevant
In both cases a summary adapted to the situation will be sent to the customer,Relevant
Finally if the customer wishes to conclude and send the notification of the damages he will have to click on Envoyer the damage will be transferred and the case will be finished,Relevant
Once the damage has been notified and that the claim has been transferred to Ma demande it will be transferred to the customer manager,Relevant
He will then process the claim starting by judging whether or not it is important,Relevant
If the claim is significant he will call in an expert to determine the amount of compensation,Relevant
Otherwise he will define the amount himself on the basis of the information provided by the customer in the Flora application,Relevant
It is possible that the customer manager may not have the necessary information to calculate the refund,Relevant
In this case he will send an e mail to the customer to request the missing information,Relevant
Once the amount of compensation has been determined the customer manager will enter it into the application,Relevant
Then if this amount is higher than 1000 euro the Flora application must approve the compensation request before sending it to the customer,Relevant
If Flora detects a flaw it will inform the customer manager who will re analyse the situation,Relevant
Otherwise if Flora approves the request for compensation or in the event that the amount is less than 100 euro the compensation proposal will be sent to the customer,Relevant
The next step depends on the client s approval of the compensation proposal,Irrelevant
If the customer approves Flora will ask for the customer s bank account number and an electronic signature via ITSME,Relevant
Once the compensation proposal has been signed the client will be reimbursed and will receive a notification that the file has been closed,Relevant
The client receives the compensation amount on his bank account and the process is thus completed,Relevant
If on the other hand the customer does not approve the compensation proposal Flora will forward this refusal to the customer manager,Relevant
The acquisition of lands and buildings process by Spi follows a certain chain of events decisions and actions,Irrelevant
First of all they start by asking the government procurement if there is any land or buildings available,Relevant
In order to do this they send a letter expressing their wish,Relevant
If there are no lands or buildings available they express to the government procurement that they are aiming to buy so they fill in a form to be added to the waiting list and they will be notified when an opportunity comes along,Relevant
If something is available the procedure usually begins with an estimation of the property solicited by the government procurement,Relevant
Then this estimation is reported to Spi,Relevant
Since Spi is aiming to rent or sell these acquisitions before they buy lands and buildings they need to be sure that they will bring interests to their clients,Relevant
So they decide to carry out a market research and see if the assets are interesting enough,Relevant
If it is not interesting they decide to drop off,Relevant
If it is interesting then Spi asks their experts to carry out their own estimation of the asset,Relevant
If the estimation matches they carry out the next step otherwise the company and the government procurement try to reach an agreement,Relevant
Without any agreement found the company can decide to end the acquisition process,Relevant
After they agree on a price Spi asks the bank if they are allowed to have a loan,Relevant
To do so the financial department provides the bank with the expertise and the result of the market research,Relevant
Then they have to wait 10 days to have a decision from the banker,Relevant
If after 10 days they don t have an answer they can reschedule an appointment to have the final decision usually if they don t have an answer after 10 days it s because the loan has been rejected so during this second meeting they will try to find a new arrangement ,Relevant
If no arrangement has been found the process ends here,Relevant
The commercialization of plots of lands and building starts when Spi receives by email the interest of a client to buy a building or a plot of land,Relevant
Then it has to acknowledge confirm the receipt in order to follow the sale,Relevant
Once the receipt acknowledges Spi has a free two month reservation to send a form to the candidate buyer,Relevant
This one fills out the request and sends it back to the company which has the duty to complete sign and date the form,Relevant
Once this first step done Spi executive board has one month to take a decision about the sale of its plots of land or building,Relevant
The agreement between these two parts remain valid for a period of six months,Relevant
Then the company gives an agreement in principle to formalize the contract and the sales otherwise if the candidate buyer doesn t respect this six month validity Spi cancels the contract and the client is obliged to give 10 of the sum of the land or the building to the company e g when the client doesn t want to buy the land anymore before the 6 months ,Relevant
When the six months are respected Spi will receive the 10 of the value of the land by the candidate buyer and it has to sign the deed,Relevant
Later Spi checks if the payment is correct and if the reservation fee has been paid in one month,Relevant
Then if all is done in the rules Spi orders the measuring plan and the placement of markers on the sold property,Relevant
The reception of the proof credit from a bank by Spi leads to the selling of the land,Relevant
Otherwise if the reservation fee is not received in one month the order is rejected,Relevant
The Head of the rental department receives a request concerning the rental of a building,Relevant
He sends the request to the legal department they check whether the request is complete and legal,Relevant
If the document is not complete the client gets a message saying that he has to complete his documents,Relevant
If the document is complete the head of the rental department schedules a meeting with the client,Relevant
During this meeting the client proposes a price,Relevant
If the price is too low the head of the department does a counterproposal which is then accepted or not by the client,Relevant
When the client refuses the negotiations are over and we consider the process done,Relevant
When a correct deal has been reached by the 2 parties we draft a contract,Relevant
When the contract is signed the process has reached its end,Relevant
The appeal for intervention process in which the trigger event is the need for services such as reparations gardening Once the problem is identified the maintenance department looks for companies with qualified people who could fill this need and then get in touch with that company,Relevant
They explain the need or issue,Relevant
If this person is indeed qualified for this request a quote is asked,Relevant
When the quote from the company is received the maintenance department examines it,Relevant
If it seems correct they send it to the financial department which determines if it fits the company s budget in order to submit their agreement or not,Relevant
If they do agree the maintenance department contacts the company again to complete the final terms and sign a contract,Relevant
Otherwise they explain to the company that they do not want to go any further and restart the search for qualified people,Relevant
Once both parties have signed the contract the financial department proceeds with the payment,Relevant
Finally the maintenance department checks the service delivery to be sure that it is well done and that it meets their expectations,Relevant
The data analysis process is done in several steps First data analysts collect data from different sources for every sector,Relevant
Then they merge the data from different sources and make a relation between them unnecessary data is cleaned in order to concentrate on the economic analysis,Relevant
Data analysts analyze the evolution of the annual revenue of the companies for each sector and they combine the data of SPI with the one coming from the outside sources,Relevant
Finally the results are interpreted and the analysts make the best economic analysis possible and come to a conclusion,Relevant
The report of the analysis is then published in the database of the company so that it is accessible to everyone,Relevant
Everything starts when a student is positive for the COVID 19,Relevant
The school will receive the information via email phone or even via SMS,Relevant
Whether it s via phone the school management will ask some specific questions such as what was the last day in class when did the student do the test when did the student receive the results and so on,Relevant
Then they will fulfil the file with their own information such as the place where the student is sitting in class the schedule from each class To do so they must dispose of the class plans,Relevant
Moreover it should be done regarding one clear and precise model,Irrelevant
Once the file is completed they can start analysing the information,Relevant
The first and the most important one is to know who the students with high risks are,Relevant
For that they will consult the class plans and will make groups of students those who are behind the positive student are not impacted nevertheless those who are on both sides from this student are risky only if they have had close contact with the positive student without masks,Relevant
Unfortunately this operation is hard because of option courses,Irrelevant
Indeed there are a lot of different class plans for these courses meaning that students are not always sitting next to the same students depending on the courses,Irrelevant
Once every single information has been collected they will send the complete file to the Safety Advisor via email,Relevant
When she receives the email she will make a first analysis then she will either transfer the file to the PSE the School Medicine or just will share the information that there is one more positive student in the school in order to receive a solution to implement,Relevant
However if it is an urgent situation the school management will take the decision to close a class without consulting the PSE,Relevant
In the normal process the PSE will analyse the sent file and will send instructions to the Safety Advisor who will send them to the school management,Relevant
On the one hand students with high risks will receive a mail with the procedure to apply and a coming back date,Relevant
On the other hand students with no risks will receive a small mail to be aware of the positive student,Relevant
If it is possible one or two members of the school management will go to the concerned class to give some extra information about the s positive student and answer some questions,Relevant
If the class is closed the school management will send another email to specify it,Relevant
Then they will phone each parent,Relevant
After that each excluded student will receive work on the LMS platform and thereby a coming back date,Relevant
The process begins when a teacher is absent,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for more than 3 months at least 15 weeks then they have to hire a priority temporary that is a teacher who has already given lessons either in the school or in a group of schools attached to the school for at least 360 days accumulated not necessarily in the same school ,Relevant
In this case the management looks in its database for a priority temporary,Relevant
If there is a priority temporary in the database they contact him her by phone,Relevant
Finally a management member sends the schedule of the teacher to be replaced to the substitute teacher and the teacher is replaced,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for less than a day then he is not replaced,Relevant
However if he she is absent for more than a day then a substitute teacher must be found,Relevant
To find a substitute teacher there are two possible ways either the candidate has sent his her CV printed and classified in a folder in order of importance of the title or via the website Primoweb on which we will be able to go do a search according to the teacher you want to hire,Relevant
Management will be able to enter a series of criteria such as the duration of the exercise the branch of expertise and so on,Relevant
Then after pushing on the search button they can see the number of titles required of sufficient titles and of shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of application by CV the candidate selection sub process begins when the file containing the applications is opened If there are required titles available then these are directly selected,Relevant
Otherwise we go to sufficient titles,Relevant
If there is no sufficient title we move on to shortage titles,Relevant
If there is no shortage title we move on to unlisted shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of a candidate who has none of these titles it would be considered an error in the system and the process would end,Relevant
Then the CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
In the case of Primoweb we will first choose the required titles then the sufficient titles and then the shortage titles the unlisted shortage titles are not listed on Primoweb ,Relevant
Then we send an email to the candidate,Relevant
If he she accepts his CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
If he she refuses then the management goes back to Primoweb and looks for another replacement again in order of degree of importance,Relevant
If he she does not respond within 3 days the management returns to Primoweb and searches for another replacement always in order of degree of importance,Relevant
This process can sometimes take a very long time,Irrelevant
After downloading the candidate s CV the members of the management will judge whether it is interesting or not,Relevant
If it s not interesting that ends the process and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If the CV is interesting we are faced with 2 situations,Relevant
If the situation is urgent for example when a teacher falls ill then the substitute teacher is directly contacted by telephone to replace the absent teacher,Relevant
If the situation is not urgent or at least foreseeable for example in the case of a work stoppage related to pregnancy then they will send an email to the candidate to prepare an interview,Relevant
The management team will then do the interview,Relevant
If the interview is successful a member of the management phones the candidate to confirm the replacement of the teacher,Relevant
If the interview is not good the candidate is rejected,Relevant
After calling the candidate they usually send the schedule of the teacher to be replaced,Relevant
The process starts when the teacher wants to do an excursion with his students,Relevant
Once the teacher has found an excursion he she has to download an excursion document located on the digital workspace of the school in order to complete the first point of the document,Relevant
Then he she has to send that document to the school management where they will check for the validity of the document,Relevant
If the document is not valid the process comes to an end and the excursion will not take place,Relevant
If the document is valid the school management has to decide if they want to let the teacher carry out the excursion or not,Relevant
If they decide to not give the permission to execute the excursion the process comes to an end,Relevant
If they decide to let the teacher do the excursion they have to sign the document and send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then evaluate the price of the excursion and he she will inform the teacher,Relevant
The teacher will then inform the parents of the excursion and give them all the necessary information such as the location the price the date and some general information about it,Relevant
After that the teacher has to wait for the parents decision to either let go or not their child on the excursion,Relevant
Once the teacher has received the parents decision he she will book the excursion and carry it out,Relevant
Once the excursion is done the teacher has to complete the rest of the excursion document and to send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then complete the document with other necessary documents such as the invoice and he she will also mention the fees of the excursion in the periodic settlement of the students so that the fees will be added to what the parents have to pay at the end of the period,Relevant
After that the document is archived and the process is completed,Relevant
Because of the covid crisis Sainte Vronique had to modify their organisation of parents meeting process,Irrelevant
Indeed parents cannot enter the school anymore,Irrelevant
The school tried the new process out in June last year and they improved it for this year,Irrelevant
The process starts when report cards are encoded in the specific software used by the school,Relevant
The student s report is then received by his or her parents,Relevant
In the report card there is a comment section in which parents can find the teachers the school wants them to meet,Irrelevant
An online form is created on the LMS and sent to the parents for each year,Relevant
The questions are the following first name and last name of the student class name of the person filling the form phone number of this person a multiple choice question with three time intervals and who are the three teachers the parents want to meet,Irrelevant
Once the due date to fill in the form is reached the form is closed by the IT manager,Relevant
The form is exported in an Excel format and the table is shared with the teachers on the LMS,Relevant
The table is posted on the right year group,Relevant
Teachers can download the document and check whether the parents who were asked to meet them are on the list,Relevant
If they are not on the list the teacher has to add them,Relevant
Once it is done the teacher can schedule the phone calls,Relevant
If needed the school can provide some phones and a room for teachers to call the parents,Relevant
If during the parents meeting the teachers notices an exceptional situation he or she has to notify the school management,Relevant
The school management will then handle the case depending on the situation,Relevant
Every new year Collge Sainte Vronique opens its enrolment process which consists of registering first year students for the following academic year,Relevant
Before entering the heart of the process the school has to achieve some optional or mandatory activities in order to prepare the enrolment period,Relevant
The mandatory one is to communicate the school capacity for first year students as well as the number of classes in the different sections general path immersion path ,Relevant
For the optional ones on the one hand they have the possibility to enter into partnerships with other institutions to facilitate the movement of students from one school to another,Relevant
On the other hand a first contact may be organized,Relevant
Then from February 10 th the first enrollment phase starts and pupils can hand over their application form to the school,Relevant
Of course the school must check if the application form is correct and well filled,Relevant
If it is not the case the application is refused and cancelled,Relevant
Next we need to distinguish the first and the second enrolment phase because applications will not be handled in the same way,Relevant
Registration requests must therefore be allocated to the period corresponding to them,Relevant
The first phase begins on February 10 and ends on March 7 while the second phase is opened from April 27 to August 24,Relevant
First registration phase Each application for registration must first be registered and then updated in the register which in most cases takes the form of a database,Relevant
In each application form there are two sections that have to be completed by parents,Irrelevant
The general part has to be hand written but for the confidential part parents have the choice to fill it online or in paper format,Relevant
If the parents choose the paper format the school is responsible for mailing the confidential section to CIRI,Relevant
Otherwise with the online form the form is directly transmitted to CIRI,Relevant
Finally the school sends a confirmation mail to say that the application has been handled correctly,Relevant
Once March 7 is reached the school closes the first registration phase,Relevant
If there are more registrations than available places pupils will be ranked according to different criteria by CIRI,Relevant
The ranking is used to attribute places to top ranked pupils,Relevant
The ranking and the result of the selection has to be sent to the pupil and parents,Relevant
If the pupil has been selected a registration certificate is created,Relevant
Else the pupil is put on the waiting list,Relevant
If there were not more registrations than available places a registration certificate is immediately created,Relevant
Second registration phase As for the first phase the school has to register each application and update the register book,Relevant
However it is not necessary to send the confidential section to CIRI because this part is used to make the ranking,Relevant
After that either the school is already complete and the pupil has to be put on the waiting list or there are still places left and a registration certificate can be immediately created for the pupil,Relevant
A student in phase 2 will not be given priority over a student in phase 1 in the waiting list,Relevant
From now the two phases can be gathered in one common path,Relevant
On the side of students who received a certificate of registration the school has to request that the pupil provides his CEB,Relevant
If the CEB is received before September 1 the process carries on,Relevant
Else the application will be rejected and a certified refusal letter with return receipt requested will be sent,Relevant
Then at the start of the school year attendance will be taken and if the pupil is not present he will have to justify his non attendance within 8 days otherwise he will be expelled,Relevant
On the side of students who are on the waiting list they have to wait until a place becomes available,Relevant
If it is the case the school will inform the pupil of the situation and will ask him whether he wants to take the place or not,Relevant
If so then a registration certificate will be written and the process will follow the normal path described earlier,Relevant
If the student refuses the place then his application will be cancelled,Relevant
A student on the waiting list can also cancel his or her application by sending a message to the school,Relevant
And lastly the waiting list is closed on August 24 which means that all students still on it will receive a certificate of refusal,Relevant
The recruitment is dealt with by the administrator Pierre Girretz himself,Irrelevant
Indeed as mentioned before the company does not have an HR department nor a true recruitment system established since the administrator can easily do this type of work himself,Irrelevant
This process is triggered only when a new post is available and it is done in a more or less informal but also classical way he receives applications and reads the CVs then Mr,Relevant
Girretz first checks if the applicant has the competencies required for the job degree experience ,Relevant
If the resume does not correspond to what is expected then the application is rejected by email with a thank you for sending the CV,Relevant
If the candidate seems to have the right competencies on paper then he receives a notification to fix a date for an interview,Relevant
Right after the interview the administrator evaluates the candidate on his personality,Relevant
Indeed Mr Girretz puts a lot of importance on his gut feeling ,Irrelevant
So if the personality matches then the candidate is given a trial period to see the quality of his work see if he can work with the team and to check if the person understands what the company needs and if he will be involved in the future,Relevant
If the candidate does not fulfill these characteristics then his application is rejected after the trial period,Relevant
Otherwise if the administrator is happy with his work he scans the person s ID and bank cards and they both sign the hiring document given by Securex and finally the applicant is officially hired after declaring the recruitment to the Dimona,Relevant
This process consists of the reception of the different supplies needed to build the pellet stoves,Irrelevant
First the supplier receives a notification with the item Sti needs then they prepare the order and notifies the company when it is ready to be sent,Relevant
When the items are received the head of the production checks their quality by following the production quality sheet s instructions and ticks the boxes corresponding,Relevant
If their quality is ok then the item s QR codes are scanned to be registered on the system and then each item is placed at the post where it will be needed to build the stoves,Relevant
In other words the head of the production paves the way for the order preparation process ,Irrelevant
However if the items are defective then a letter is written to explain the problem to the supplier and the supplies are sent back to receive better ones,Relevant
When a client wants to buy a stove he needs to request a quote on Sti s website and to choose from a list of characteristics his dream pellet stove,Relevant
Then when the company receives it assuming every item is in stock the order preparation process can begin,Relevant
Employees working in the production line start by identifying the type of stove the client wishes to order they write down the model the power of the stove optional features and they also transfer the quote to the reseller since he will be the one in charge of providing the final product to the customer,Relevant
After that the production line checks if the items needed for assembly are in stock,Relevant
If not an order request is sent to the supplier to receive the missing supplies,Relevant
When every item is in stock employees search for pieces emplacement in the system thanks to the QR code they scanned when they first received the items,Relevant
Then the actual assembly can start the goods go from post to post the stove is built little by little at every step,Relevant
Once it reaches post number N the number of posts depending on each case the final product is fully built and is ready to go through a quality check,Relevant
Once this quality check process is done the pellet stove is packaged in a plastic cover and a wood box,Relevant
Finally it can be shipped to the reseller store which will be in charge of selling the stove to the customer,Relevant
This process is basically about testing the stove from A to Z looking for leaks checking for malfunctions and so on,Irrelevant
The quality check is once again done in the production line,Irrelevant
The process starts when a stove is done being assembled and ends when it is operational and can be sent to the reseller,Relevant
In the first step the employees fill in the production quality sheet by first writing down the stove s info like the guaranteed number the model its options the customer s details and so on,Relevant
Next the stove s components are checked and tested by following the sheet s instructions,Relevant
They then turn the engine on to check it works perfectly and that there is no leak or any other problem as said previously,Relevant
If there is an issue then workers use the QR code system we talked about earlier to find which pieces are missing or misplaced in the stove and fix them,Relevant
When they are sure the stove is working well they can start to suck potential dirt and clean the whole stove,Relevant
Once both are done they stick an A++ label and a CE European Conformity label on the door of the engine,Relevant
After that the rest of the quality sheet has to be filled up,Relevant
Then an instruction sheet a plan of the stove and a list of the items are added to the packaging of the pellet stove,Relevant
In the end the product is fully operational and is ready to leave the company,Relevant
The after sales process begins when a client needs professional intervention,Relevant
When the client wishes to do its stove s annual maintenance a qualified operator is sent to its home,Relevant
In that case it is not Sti who is responsible for that operation but the stoves reseller store depending on the localization stores in Belgium France Switzerland ,Relevant
So Sti s employees will not take care of the maintenance but rather an external professional who has conducted one of Sti s training or a mechanic who has Sti s approval to operate on its stoves will do it,Relevant
If the client needs an intervention because its stove has a technical problem then it contacts Sti,Relevant
The administrator the chief technician and the head of the production can all take care of the process indifferently,Irrelevant
When the company is notified it then fills in the after sales form by between others selecting the stove type and its features the MAC   IP addresses of the stove the type of service it needs and by writing the customer s and the reseller s contact information,Relevant
If the stove needs a physical intervention because it cannot be dealt with remotely then the problem is handed over to MILLE Services a subsidiary company,Relevant
After receiving information on the problem this company will then send one of its technicians to repair the stove then the after sales form will be signed by both the customer and MILLE Services,Relevant
Otherwise if physical intervention is not necessary which is mostly the case then Sti will solve the problem remotely through the internet thanks to the app it recently developed,Relevant
So first they will use this app to detect the problem on the stove then they will change the engine s parameters through the remote control system and will fill in the sheet with every problem encountered while doing so,Relevant
When they are done they check if the stove is operational,Relevant
If so the after sales document is signed and the process is over,Relevant
If not then the stove will need a supplementary intervention physically thus Sti contacts MILLE Services and the service is handed to them as stated previously,Relevant
This process begins with the registration of the quotation,Relevant
When the welder load is planned he will assign a design engineer to the project,Relevant
First of all the planner will plan the welder load,Relevant
After that several things will be made simultaneously,Relevant
On the one hand the quality manager will design the quality plan,Relevant
On the other hand the design engineer will first analyze the file in order to be able to draw the nomenclature of the project,Relevant
After that the welding engineer will give the soudage instructions,Relevant
Then the process will continue with the calculation engineer who will make the calculation,Relevant
When these two simultaneous parts of the process will be covered the pawn can move on to the resolution of questions task executed by the design engineer,Relevant
When all the questions will be covered it is the task of the project manager to validate the project,Relevant
Now it will be up to the client to look at the drawing to approbate it in order to launch the creation of the project,Relevant
If the customer has other questions he will send an email to the company to disapprove the drawing,Relevant
The design engineer will be obliged to do the task of questions resolution again,Relevant
If the customer approves the drawing the company will receive an email from him,Relevant
After having received the customer approbation the company will purchase its raw materials,Relevant
The project will then be sent to the workshop,Relevant
Two sub processes will then be required simultaneously,Relevant
The production traceability and the inspection,Relevant
After that the calculation note will be drafted by the calculation engineer and the welding book by the welding engineer,Relevant
The plan as built will then be drawn,Relevant
The process ends with the expedition,Relevant
It is important to know that Into this process each thing that will be associated with creation or assignment will be included in the ERP in the file created in the quotation registration,Irrelevant
The process begins when the purchasing department receives a purchase need,Relevant
They will first analyze the request,Relevant
Then they will check if an authorized provider exists,Relevant
In fact they must have to work with suppliers accepted by Ortmans in order to be certain of the quality of the service,Irrelevant
If a valid supplier exists for the requirement then we send him a request for quotation If this is not the case the quality assurance manager will seek out a new supplier and evaluate it,Relevant
Once this is done we can send the request for a quote,Relevant
When the purchasing department receives the quote it is analyzed and then an order is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Once the order is received by the storekeeper he will check the quantity received via the shipping document,Relevant
If a control card exists then a quality controller must inspect the delivery qualitatively,Relevant
Then the conformity is checked via the ERP by the storekeeper,Relevant
If the order is compliant then it synchronizes the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase is complete,Relevant
If the order is non compliant then the quality assurance manager will initiate a process to manage non compliance,Relevant
Once this is completed the storekeeper can synchronize the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase will be completed,Relevant
At another time the billing department will receive the invoice of the order which will start their process,Relevant
This will be checked in the ERP,Relevant
Once the service is notified that the receipt of the order has been synchronized in the ERP it can proceed to the payment and the payment will be completed,Relevant
The improvement action process starts with an improvement demand based on different sources internal or external audit report management review customer complaint non compliance suggestion etc,Relevant
The request is then registered in the Excel table by the Quality Assurance Manager Q A M ,Relevant
This excel file will be used all along the process,Irrelevant
It is important to detect the issue which means that an analysis of the problem in order to know the ins and outs of each approach will be conducted by the Q A M,Relevant
Then the Q A M will conduct a criticality analysis in order to put the necessary resources on the actions that require it,Relevant
A corresponding amelioration file will be created in the excel table,Relevant
It will help in the choice of whether or not to initiate an improvement action,Irrelevant
When the amelioration file is finished the Q A M will be able to analyse the issue properly,Relevant
If there is no improvement needed the Q A M will answer to the improvement demand applicant with if possible an explanation for the refusal,Relevant
However if an improvement is needed the Q A M will determine the action with a reasonable timeframe and a person responsible for the action,Relevant
Those elements will also be added to the excel file,Relevant
When the action and those who are in charge of it are defined the Q A M will inform the direction,Relevant
When the direction is informed of the issue she provides the necessary means and then launches the action,Relevant
The Implementation of the improvement action is then carried out by the action responsible,Relevant
In parallel the Q A M follows up this implementation of the improvement action,Relevant
When the improvement action is finished the Q A M checks the effectiveness of the action implemented i e checking that the action focuses on the causes and not only on the consequences,Relevant
If the result is satisfying the improvement action process ends there,Relevant
Otherwise the criticality analysis must be reseen and the process starts again from this point,Relevant
The process starts when an unconformity is detected,Relevant
A non conformity must be declared when one or more of the following conditions are met ,Irrelevant
Immediate repair at no significant cost is not possible,Irrelevant
Immediate repair at low cost is possible but the problem is recurrent,Irrelevant
Immediate low cost repair is possible but can lead to an opportunity for improvement,Irrelevant
Supplier defect which includes not only raw material suppliers but also service providers and subcontractors ,Irrelevant
Customer complaint is the subject of a complaint and therefore a complaint sheet is completed and if necessary a non conformity sheet is completed,Irrelevant
The initials of the initiator with the date are added on the sticker who must be created to mark the non conformity,Relevant
Next they have to fill in the non conformity sheets so that they do not have to search for information that is known to the initiator,Relevant
The NCS is transmitted to the QAM who is responsible for its follow up,Relevant
Record in Excel file for follow up,Relevant
The QAM communicates the NCS to the PM Project manager ,Relevant
The person who is responsible for the non compliance is the quality manager,Irrelevant
This is the quality manager who makes a proposal for action at the project manager,Relevant
It is the PM who makes the decision whether or not to accept this proposal for action,Relevant
If the answer is no the quality manager must make another proposal for action,Relevant
If it is approved the project manager notifies the client and waits to receive the formal acceptance of the client,Relevant
If the client doesn t accept it is up to the quality manager to remake another proposal action,Relevant
Both QAM and the quality manager must decide for verifications to do if the client accepts the proposal action,Relevant
Now it is up to the quality manager to make improvement actions and verify these actions back,Relevant
He will close the NCS remove the marking non conformity and notify the QAM who shall verify the process make analysis,Relevant
After the analysis if he decides that other improvement actions must be taken they will make a new one,Relevant
If not they will archive the non conformity,Relevant
The process starts when a client needs new equipment and asks the company for a quotation,Relevant
The project manager receives the request and analyzes it in terms of solvency of the client and in terms of capacity of the company to produce the client s equipment,Relevant
An acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the client,Relevant
The project manager asks the management for an approval and depending what the management will decide the client s request will be approved or not,Relevant
If the request is rejected the project manager will send a rejection to the client otherwise the process continues and the project s file is created with an ERP s number,Relevant
Then the design office makes an analysis of the different technical aspects and a quotation request is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Finally with all the information received the project manager makes the quote and then asks the management for some advice about the quote,Relevant
Afterward the project manager establishes the offer which is registered in the ERP and sends it to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer the project manager receives the order form,Relevant
The order form is registered in the ERP system and a confirmation is sent to the client,Relevant
The contract is reviewed by the project manager the file is prepared and information is sent for the registration to delivery process and the quotation registration process is ended,Relevant
This process happens repeatedly throughout the day to journalists,Relevant
Indeed they have to write several articles for the next day s daily journal,Irrelevant
The main subject of an article usually comes from an informant with a scoop last minute information or from requests for coverage or news they received for example through the alert us button of their website ,Irrelevant
Daily news and important events have priority over more common subjects,Irrelevant
Therefore if crucial information is given by someone with a high position or an informant to a journalist he must not hesitate to dive in and collect more information about it,Irrelevant
Once the subject is received or chosen the first step is confirming the information with a reliable person,Relevant
We will consider Lige s Christmas market cancellation as an example,Irrelevant
The journalist obtaining this information then has to ask Lige s mayor to confirm it,Relevant
However if the information comes from the alert us button the journalist will set up a meeting with the person in order to further analyze it,Relevant
A subject with incoherent or false information will be rejected whereas the process will continue for a reliable and true subject,Relevant
If a journalist were to obtain crucial information it must be published even partially as soon as possible so that it is not stolen from the competition,Relevant
Thus it is directly posted on Sudpresse s paying website,Relevant
On the contrary if the information can wait the journalist should collect more details about it,Relevant
Once it is done the journalist makes a synthesis of the information he has received to this point to know what he should search next,Relevant
In both cases phone calls emails and internet researches will follow in order to complete and detail the current subject,Relevant
The information research process ends as soon as the journalist has gathered enough detailed information to write the article,Relevant
The journalist is responsible for this process from its start to its end,Irrelevant
Sometimes as demonstrated in the previous process information must be revealed without delay to readers with a subscription,Irrelevant
That is why the information written as quickly as possible will be briefly explained on Sudpresse s paying website,Irrelevant
Following this event a strategic marketing employee in the newsroom creates a teasing placed on the free website,Relevant
This teasing includes a link to the company s paying website,Irrelevant
Afterwards the journalist will progressively continue filling out the online article on the paying website adding information and upgrading the layout until it is complete and perfect,Relevant
The journalist contacts his sources to find new he can add to his article,Relevant
If he gets new information from a tier he contacts this tier that becomes thus one of a source or any other source who can verify clarify this new information,Relevant
The last version of the online article will be published the next morning in the traditional newspaper,Relevant
Compared to a few years ago journalists do not write complete articles that only come out the following day as they first have to post them online,Irrelevant
This applies to any level of importance of the information,Irrelevant
Then once the article has been completed and is published on the different websites and when due to the tight timing the article must be finished to be in the next day s newspaper the journalist asks for a page of the next day s daily journal and starts copying the article s content,Relevant
Before every publication digital or paper the articles are corrected by a spelling software a first time and a second time by a professional reviewer whose job is to avoid mistakes in the spelling and to ensure an optimal layout for the article,Relevant
Once the page for the daily newspaper is finished it is sent to the rotary press in Nivelles,Relevant
This concludes the article writing and publishing process,Relevant
As soon as the pages from the different upcoming newspapers are received the printing process begins at the Nivelles printing,Relevant
First relief plates are made for every single page of each newspaper,Relevant
Then these plates are put four by four on the rotary press,Relevant
Once this step is operated the rotary press is switched on,Relevant
Then plates go in the four primary colors and the newspapers pages are printed,Relevant
At this stage a mechanical system allows to assemble pages with one another fold and bind them to form the newspaper,Relevant
The newspapers are then automatically packaged and are ready to be shipped,Relevant
During the whole work of the machine printing assembling the work of the employee is simply reduced to monitor the machine,Irrelevant
The supply process of daily newspapers is critical and is obviously relying on the nature of past processes,Irrelevant
Any delay can be toxic for the supply process and could cause terrible financial losses for Sudpresse and for booksellers themselves,Irrelevant
First we will focus on individual newspaper delivery,Irrelevant
Newspapers must be ready for delivery at 01 00 a m they are put into trucks and taken to the sorting office in Brussels,Relevant
They are then charged 30 minutes before the departure into night trains taking them to the cities where the different sorting centers are located,Relevant
Once the newspapers are in those centers vans are used to deliver them to the local post offices,Relevant
The postmen then deliver the newspapers in individual mailboxes,Relevant
This must take place before 7 30am as it is essential that a good part of workers have enough time to read their newspaper before going to work,Relevant
We will now focus on bookshops delivery,Irrelevant
Instead of going to the Sorting post office in Brussels trucks go straight to regional private delivery centers,Relevant
Newspapers are then sorted and dispatched in vans that deliver over four thousand bookshops all over Belgium,Relevant
This type of delivery should take place even earlier than the individual deliveries 7am at the latest as bookshops make half of their daily sales before 9 am,Irrelevant
Through this process description we realize that timing is essential in the press sector,Irrelevant
Nowadays writing and creating new articles does not suffice to create enough value for multimedia companies,Irrelevant
Therefore various advertising processes are in constant change in the press industry and are therefore impossible to describe entirely,Irrelevant
Nevertheless thanks to the two interviews we have conducted with our contacts at Sudpresse we were able to identify some crucial steps in these processes,Irrelevant
We established earlier that there is a market department running many analyses in order to determine what are the best advertising spots on the website which format which size which colors which position on the page etc,Relevant
The IT department will then determine who sees what advert and most importantly these people s background and profile by using big data,Relevant
Once the advertising spots have been defined it is time for the sales department to intervene,Relevant
Using the data previously collected sales teams have to sell these spots to advertisers,Relevant
Advertisers have many options,Irrelevant
On the newspaper they can choose to advertise on a quarter of a page half a page or an entire page knowing that each of these options has a different cost and impact on the reader,Relevant
Different spots can be chosen on the website,Irrelevant
One option of advertising on the website is through storytelling which has been a growing tendency in the previous years,Relevant
In this case advertising is made through an interview of a representative of the concerned company ending with a link to the company s website,Relevant
The interview is in this case realized after the writing of the contract,Relevant
An advertisement may appear one or multiple times depending on the agreement that has been made between the sales teams and the advertiser,Relevant
Once the advertiser has decided what he wishes to do a contract is written by the sales department of Sudpresse,Relevant
When it is done the contract is sent to the advertiser,Relevant
The contract is often approved by the advertisers,Relevant
If it is not the contract is reviewed,Relevant
A contract is never abandoned because if a contract has been written it is because there is a demand from an advertiser,Irrelevant
The advert is then created and published in the chosen canals with a determined frequency and time frame,Relevant
The catering process starts when a customer calls a Poivre Sel point of sale for its services,Relevant
One of the employees answers the phone call and asks automatically for the date and the number and variety of products wanted,Relevant
The employee then asks for the customer s usual point of sale,Relevant
If the client doesn t call his her usual point of sale the employee has to conduct the customer to the usual one and the order is sent there,Relevant
If the client is a new or a usual one 10 the employee then asks for the address,Relevant
Afterwards he checks the availability of the employees on this date and this address,Relevant
If none of the employees is available the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the employee answering the call determines the type category of the client and as a result of this proposes a series of products specific to the client,Relevant
It is then the job of the franchisor CEO to emit the invoice to the client,Relevant
He receives the payment and checks if there is any missing information,Relevant
If information is missing he sends a formal notice to the customer with the ERP system of Poivre Sel Teamleader ,Relevant
The franchisor receives the missing information and if it is still missing the purchase order is rejected,Relevant
When the payment is completed the employees can start the order,Relevant
They deliver the order at the social event and the purchase order is completed,Relevant
The franchising process is quite simple,Irrelevant
Anyone interested in becoming a franchisee can obtain information at a point of sale or and on the website,Relevant
He then contacts Mr Buche to ask him if he can become a franchisee,Relevant
Then Mr Buche will meet with the interested party to explain the principle of his company and its history,Relevant
After this discussion he asks the franchisee if he is still interested,Relevant
The franchisee will then give an answer to the franchisor,Relevant
If he decides to continue then Mr Buche will take him on a day long immersion trip to his point of sale in order to learn more about the franchisee and to show him how a day in a point of sale goes,Relevant
After that day both parties take a week to think about whether or not they want to continue,Relevant
The decision comes from both parties,Relevant
If they continue the prospective franchisee must sign a confidentiality document,Relevant
Once this is done the franchisee starts looking for a location for their new outlet,Relevant
Once he has found it he will show it to Mr Buche so that he can take care of the market research and a cost benefit calculation to see if the location is ideal and profitable,Relevant
If it is not the franchisee has to look for another location,Relevant
If it is the calculations are sent to the franchisee s accountant for validation,Relevant
Once validated it takes a few months for the fieldworks to be completed and then the franchisee pays Mr Buche for the fieldworks,Relevant
The franchisee can then finally open his point of sale,Relevant
The franchisee receives the calendar of meetings for the year,Irrelevant
One of the franchisees has a new recipe idea,Relevant
He waits for the next meeting to propose it,Relevant
Then we see if the idea is appreciated if not we stop,Relevant
If it is appreciated the franchisee who had the idea suggests to make a vote,Relevant
The vote is made with all the franchisees and the franchisor by raising their hand,Relevant
If the majority raises their hands we make the recipe if not the requested is rejected,Relevant
A customer arrives in front of the cashier at Poivre Sel to eat,Relevant
First of all the cashier asks him whether he is eating on the spot or to take away,Relevant
If the customer eats on the spot the waiter makes him sit down and asks the customer what he wants to eat,Relevant
Once the order is taken the waiter gives the order to the cook who prepares it and gives it back to the waiter once it is ready,Relevant
The waiter then takes the dish back and serves it to the customer,Relevant
Then the waiter waits until the customer s meal is over i e when the customer calls the waiter,Relevant
The waiter will then send him the invoice and receive payment from the customer and then hand over the money received at the cash desk,Relevant
If the customer has taken out the cashier asks the customer for the order,Relevant
Then gives the order to the cook who prepares it and returns it to the cashier once the preparation is finished,Relevant
Then the cashier issues the invoice to the customer who pays it and the cashier gives him his meal,Relevant
If a product is missing from Poivre Sel he rings their supplier to see if the product is available the office manager checks the database to see if the product is still in stock,Relevant
If the product is available we ask for the quantity of this product x at Poivre Sel which will determine the quantity and then notify the supplier who will be able to prepare an invoice and send it once the invoice is received and paid the stock manager will supply the product at Poivre Sel,Relevant
If the product is no longer available the supplier asks for salt and pepper if he wants to order if the answer is no it is the end of the process if it is yes the supplier sends all the information invoice delivery date by e mail,Relevant
The process starts with the arrival of the worker at Emerson,Relevant
A renewal contract is when the end of his last contract is greater than 12 months,Irrelevant
He goes to the line manager who welcomes him then he signs the contract and receives the badge,Relevant
Later the line manager accompanies him to the social store,Relevant
He begins his training and medical supervision and the process is over for him,Relevant
If the duration of his contract is less than 12 months it is considered as a first contract,Relevant
Therefore the worker is registered at the guard post then he is greeted by the head of the department who signs the contract and accompanies him to the social store and shows the worker the factory,Relevant
Later the HR Business Partner transmits the Welcome Pack to the worker then the training coordinator receives singled documents and classifies documents in personal files,Relevant
If an IT account must be created the training coordinators must first present and then send the signature of the IT policy,Relevant
If not the worker can receive induction training and medical supervision directly,Relevant
The process starts with the expiration of the contract,Relevant
Then an exit interview takes place with the temporary worker and the coordinator his release date is encoded on HR Access the human resources management software package,Relevant
The C4 the unemployment certificate and the certificate of employment is sent and issued to the worker by the coordinator then who then archives the paper file,Relevant
After that the worker returns first clothes and keys at the social store and then the badge after the last score,Relevant
Finally the HR Payroll Specialist triggers the bonus at the end of year in HR access applies the legislation on payment of the days after discharge clears RHT and RTT hours and the process is ended,Relevant
The process starts with the payment of a deposit,Relevant
Then the HP Payroll Specialist emails to horses managers before 10 a m to conclude it,Relevant
Later he carries out a different point of the checklist and encodes down payment work on the HR Access software,Relevant
He then downloads the payment batch on the bank s website and requests the lot signature to the Finance Manager who signs it,Relevant
Finally the HP Payroll Specialist checks the sent lot and the worker receives the salary,Relevant
The process begins with the requirement of the Emerson Company,Relevant
The plant HR director invites the hierarchical manager to establish the schedule of objective meetings who will then carry out the evaluation with his employee via the HR Access pre software and will then transmit to the plant HR director,Relevant
if the manager has received the evaluations he must review them otherwise the plant HR director will invite the hierarchical manager again to review the evaluations and continue the process,Relevant
If the assessment is understandable the plant HR director if we need training if so we set up training and we evolve the performance of the end of the year and the performance assessment is completed,Relevant
If the evaluation sent is incomprehensible the plant HR director discusses with the hierarchical manager who will complete and inform the collaborator who will send the document back to the plant HR director for review evaluation and the process continues normally,Relevant
The process starts when a position becomes available,Relevant
The HR Business Partner drafts the internal announcement and the HR Director validates the content of the announcement via the HR Access pre software then sends it to the HR Business Partner for the dissemination of the internal announcement,Relevant
The HR Business Partner determines the evaluation criteria and then receives the applications by email,Relevant
The HR Business Partner conducts interviews and tests and evaluates them afterwards,Relevant
If the candidates respond to the applications of the function they are informed by email and their personal data is deleted with the HR access pre software and finally they are ready to be hired,Relevant
If the candidates do not respond to the applications of the function they consult the reserve of spontaneous applications,Relevant
The first business process is inbound logistics,Irrelevant
An employee takes care of placing the order with the suppliers,Relevant
All the raw materials needed to manufacture the finished products are stored in a large refrigerated hall within the company,Relevant
There is also a storage room that serves as a freezer because some materials arrive frozen,Irrelevant
The process of outbound logistics is quite similar to that of inbound logistics,Irrelevant
First of all the company receives requests for the delivery of goods from outside supermarkets small shops ,Relevant
Then Goumanisto checks its stocks to see if it has the quantities requested by the buyers,Relevant
If it does not have them it will send a note to inform the purchasing company of the impossibility of supplying the quantities requested,Relevant
The purchasing company can also decide to maintain the order in which case Goumanisto will produce the missing products,Relevant
Once the products are available the company will make up pallets that will be sent to the various stores via a delivery company,Relevant
As far as the recruitment process is concerned it starts when a person shows interest in working for the company,Relevant
For operators Goumanisto either uses a temporary employment agency to provide the necessary manpower or receives unsolicited applications most of which are based on the knowledge of existing workers,Relevant
Each recruitment procedure consists of a minimum of 2 sometimes 3 interviews with the applicant,Relevant
The first one is with the direct manager i e the operations manager if the company is looking to hire an operator,Relevant
The second interview takes place in the presence of the company s managers,Relevant
Following this second interview they decide whether or not the person is suitable,Relevant
Production is a very important business process at Goumanisto,Irrelevant
About 50 people are employed in production and almost half of them come from the sheltered workshop,Irrelevant
The first room is made up of a recently acquired machine it allows the various products to be cut very quickly and precisely,Relevant
Four to five workers are needed for this machine to work properly,Relevant
Then there is another machine that weighs the cut products and divides them into different batches according to the quantities required,Relevant
The next step is the reception of the products and their packaging,Relevant
This step is done by production line,Relevant
Currently there is a manual line with 10 people and an automated line with 5 people,Relevant
The automatic line checks that the machines properly close the boxes with plastic paper then the manual line closes the boxes with plastic lids,Relevant
Goumanisto s objective is to acquire a new automated line by February 2021,Irrelevant
Finally the various plastic boxes have to be closed and packed in cardboard boxes both operations are still done manually,Relevant
This one could be a good candidate for automation,Irrelevant
Indeed the labelling and the placing of the products packed in the cardboard boxes are still done manually so it would represent a saving of time if the company were to automate this process,Irrelevant
R D is also an important process for the organization,Irrelevant
Members are looking for new product ideas that may appeal to consumers,Irrelevant
Most often the company uses market research done by the wholesale distribution to whom it sells its products instead of doing its own surveys,Relevant
Then they analyze the results of market research in order to embark on the development of new ideas of products,Relevant
The point of product ideas is obviously that these products can be sold in large quantities and at a lower price,Irrelevant
Then they compute the potential costs of producing these new product ideas,Relevant
If these can be profitable and lead to profit subsequently they are validated by the R D department and presented to the general council,Relevant
On the other hand if they could not be profitable everything falls apart and the process stops,Relevant
It will therefore be necessary to start all over from the development of new product ideas,Relevant
The process starts when a client wants to employ temporary workers,Relevant
The client sends an email with a job description to the agency,Relevant
An Asap consultant analyzes the job description,Relevant
Then he checks if there is an existing profile in the agency s database,Relevant
If a matching profile has been found the process to employ a candidate begins,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed the process ends,Relevant
If he has not been employed the consultant will recheck in the database in order to search for another potential profile,Relevant
If one is found the loop is going again,Relevant
If not an announcement is published on the agency site,Relevant
Moreover the consultant has to check the specificity of the job,Relevant
Indeed when the client wants a very specific candidate the agency has to actively research a candidate in addition to the published announcement,Relevant
When the job does not require any specific skills the consultant only needs to wait for candidates to propose themselves,Relevant
Whether it would be a specific or a non specific job when a candidate respondsto the announcement the to employ a candidate process can start,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed the process ends,Relevant
If the candidate has not been employed the consultant researches or waits again for a candidate to answer the announcement,Relevant
However if the agency can not find a candidate fast enough the client must send a message to the agency to ask them to stop the process,Relevant
Indeed the client works with several agencies so if another agency finds a candidate before Asap the client has to warn Asap,Relevant
So when Asap receives a message from the client the agency must stop his searching process,Relevant
The process starts when a profile of interim which matches with the announcement has been found,Relevant
The first step is to call the candidate for a phone screening,Relevant
After the phone call the candidate and the consultant agree for a date for a meeting,Relevant
Another option is that the consultant realized during the phonescreening that the candidate was not suitable for the job,Relevant
If so the process ends,Relevant
If a meeting has been agreed the consultant sends an email to the candidate with a confirmed date and some information over the meeting,Relevant
On the convenued day the candidate goes to the meeting and the consultant rules the meeting,Relevant
The meeting starts when the candidate arrives,Relevant
So the consultant can start the meeting,Irrelevant
Before discussing specific topics of the job he has to check the candidate references,Relevant
After the discussion the candidate has to pass a cognitive test,Relevant
The meeting ends when he leaves,Relevant
After the meeting the consultant sends a report over the meeting to the client,Relevant
Then they have to wait for the client to respond,Relevant
When the client sends a feedback of the report to the agency there are two possibilities,Relevant
On one hand if the feedback is bad the client does not want the candidate so the agency must send him a rejection message,Relevant
In this case the process ends,Relevant
On the other hand if the feedback is good the client wants the candidate so the agency must send him an approval message,Relevant
After sending the message the consultant makes the contract that he sends for the candidate to confirm and sign the contract,Relevant
The candidate resends the signed contract to the agency which then sends the contract to the client,Relevant
In this case the candidate is employed and the process ends,Relevant
When the social secretary of ASAP receives the hours worked by the candidate for the client the process can start,Relevant
The first step is to inform the bank to pay the hours worked,Relevant
When the bank receives the message from ASAP she has to pay the worked hours to the candidate s bank account,Relevant
The candidate is then informed that he has received the payment,Relevant
The candidate checks if the payment is correct,Relevant
If it is the case the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not he must inform the agency about the payment error,Relevant
On the side of the agency if she doesn t receive a message from the candidate the process is fulfilled but when a payment error message is received the agency must check if the candidate has been paid too much or not enough paid,Relevant
When the candidate has not been paid enough the bank has to pay the extra hours on the candidate bank account and the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If the candidate has been too much paid the agency must request a refund from the candidate,Relevant
So the candidate pays the hours not worked to the bank and the process ends,Relevant
We can imagine that the candidates would not send an error message if he has been paid too much,Irrelevant
However some of them do and ASAP counts on their honesty ,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee evaluation is needed,Relevant
The superior calls the employee,Relevant
They plan a meeting together,Relevant
After the phone call the superior sends an email with the confirmed date of the meeting,Relevant
On the said date the employee goes to the meeting,Relevant
So the superior can start the meeting,Relevant
He first checks if the KPIs of the employee are good,Relevant
Then he discusses with him about his general feeling in the company,Relevant
After that the superior can end the meeting,Relevant
When the meeting is finished and the employee is left the superior makes a feedback that he sends to his employee,Relevant
From there there are three possibilities,Relevant
Either the feedback is good so nothing happens or it is the first bad feedback so the superior warns his employee or it is the second bad feedback so the superior sends a breach of contract to his employee,Relevant
After each possibility the process ends,Relevant
We can surely say that the breach of the contract can be negotiated depending on the circumstances ,Irrelevant
When the agency has given a service to one of his clients a consultant makes an invoice,Relevant
The business manager then checks the invoice,Relevant
The invoice may not be correct if the client has had a credit note on a past delivery ,Irrelevant
If the invoice is not correct the business manager resends the invoice to the consultant and he has to make the invoice again,Relevant
If the invoice is correct the consultant can send the invoice to the client,Relevant
When the invoice has been sent the consultant waits for the payment,Relevant
If the payment arrives within 5 days the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not the case the consultant calls the client with a first warning,Relevant
After this call if the payment has been completed within 5 days the process ends,Relevant
If not the account manager calls the client for a second warning,Relevant
The client has to pay within 5 days to finish the process if not the account manager sends an email about a potential bailiff venue and informs the bailiff about his potential venue,Relevant
To finish the process there are two possibilities,Relevant
Either the client pays his debt within 50 days and the process ends or the account manager contacts the bailiff and the process is finished,Relevant
the delays are so short because ASAP has to pay the temporary workers one week after the last day of the mission As mentioned above ,Irrelevant
The process starts with the interest of the client in finding a solution to the digital transformation his company needs the first task is to propose and describe the 3 Bizz Online packs get a response from the client charge him and inform DJM,Relevant
The first contact always starts within Proximus stores but the salesman only acts as an intermediate and only during the selling phase after fulfilling the order he steps out of the conversation and an employee of DJM takes this over firstly the manager,Relevant
The process starts when a customer enters a Proximus shop either the customer goes to a Proximus shop because he is a freelancer interested in the Bizz online packs or the seller proposes the Bizz online packs to him,Relevant
If the customer refuses the offer the process is over,Relevant
On the other hand if the customer is interested in the pack the seller offers him the choice between 3 packs S M L,Relevant
These packs are categorized according to their size options and functionality,Irrelevant
They go from the most basic to the most specific,Irrelevant
Once the customer has made his choice the seller informs a DJM manager of the customer s new request via an ERP system set up between the 2 companies DJM and Proximus,Relevant
Bizz online employees then start a discussion with the customer in order to prepare the website as well as possible,Relevant
When the website is prepared it is sent to the customer who can then request the latest changes if he wants before the website is published,Relevant
If the client is satisfied with the website it is published on the internet and the process is completed,Relevant
If the customer does not respond to the message sent within 5 days a reminder message is sent,Relevant
This process starts when the client who has already chosen either the M pack or the L pack is interested in receiving an e shop as an option in his pack,Relevant
After invoicing in a Proximus shop the request of the client goes to a project manager of Bizz online who gets in touch with the client so that they can discuss the project,Relevant
Then it s the webmaster who produces the e shop taking into account the suggestions of the client and does the modifications if necessary,Relevant
This process ends when the e shop is published,Relevant
The process starts when the manager receives a complaint,Relevant
He then registers it and transfers it to the webmaster,Relevant
The webmaster analyses the complaint and if more information is needed he recontacts the client to receive the missing pieces of information,Relevant
If he can resolve it directly he skips those steps and resolves it,Relevant
Then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when a jobseeker sends his or her application to DJM by e mail,Relevant
The project manager receives the application and checks whether it contains the CV and covering letter whether it contains the basic data such as name and surname and whether the applicant has the required diploma to work at DJM,Relevant
If the documents are incomplete the project manager will inform the applicant,Relevant
If the documents are complete the project manager will contact the applicant through one of the channels provided on the CV to find a time to place an interview,Relevant
After the interview if the candidate is hired the project manager will send a rejection email,Relevant
After the interview if the candidate is hired an email is also sent to inform him her of the news,Relevant
The project manager then begins to enter the information collected from the application,Relevant
If he she notices that he she is missing data he she contacts the candidate again to complete the application with the missing data,Relevant
Then he creates the contract which he then sends,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is needed,Relevant
Then the first task is made by the Head of department who has to give specific criteria of the job requirements skills needed ,Relevant
Once the task is completed the HR employee has to see if it is a specific more special demand or not,Relevant
Usually for nurses they will look at spontaneous applications on the hospital website,Relevant
For more specific functions they will externalize the process and recruit via Forum,Relevant
For more special requests for example energy engineer they make an offer on the website themselves,Relevant
After having collected the CV the HR employee has to to make a selection based on the head of department s criteria,Relevant
If there are a lot of applications he can decide to filter the candidates by doing a written exam in order to screen people,Relevant
Due to the written exam he has to select candidate and review application,Relevant
Once the task is completed he has to decide if he approve or not the candidate,Relevant
If he didn t approve it a rejection email will be sent to the applicant and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case the HR employee will have to schedule an online interview,Relevant
The head of the department has to conduct the personal interview and based on that he will decide if he hire or not the candidate,Relevant
If he doesn t want to hire him or her a rejection email is sent to the candidate and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case the head of department has to inform the HR employee that the applicant is hired,Relevant
Finally the HR employee has to create an administrative file with the applicant s information and create the employment contract,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished = applicant employed ,Relevant
The process takes place in emergencies,Irrelevant
It starts when a patient arrives at the emergency room,Relevant
The emergency service has to register the patient and take his or her vital parameters as blood pressure and so on,Relevant
These data are entered in the DPI system by the emergency service which allows the doctor even if he is not on site to consult that information,Relevant
The doctor specialist has to check the patient s data,Relevant
based on that he has to evaluate the urgency,Relevant
If he considers that it is not urgent he has to give instructions to the emergency doctor,Relevant
Then the emergency doctor has to treat the patient schedule an appointment and discharge him or her,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case which means that the doctor specialist considers that it is an urgency he has to inform the nurses and check bed availability at the same time,Relevant
Nurses will then register the person in their department,Relevant
They absolutely have to have the approval of the medical specialist before they admit someone,Relevant
They cannot register a patient without that,Irrelevant
Finally the nurses have to move the patient from the emergency room to the room service,Relevant
The process starts when medications are needed,Relevant
The first task is made by the nurse who has to check their department s drug needs for each patient,Relevant
The nurse then group everything together and send the order by fax usually to the pharmacy,Relevant
In all hospitals there is a pharmacy so orders are sent there and directly processed,Relevant
The pharmacy checks if they have everything usually they have everything ,Relevant
If some medications are missing they have to inform the nurse of the product s non availability,Relevant
Then they have to check the availability of the medications in another service and send someone to take them,Relevant
Once they have received the medications they have to notify the nurse prepare all the medications and finally deliver them to the nurse,Relevant
The last task is made by the nurse who has to prepare the medications for each patient,Relevant
Once the task is done the process is finished = medications prepared ,Relevant
There are several possible cases ,Irrelevant
In case of end of contract At the end of the contract replacement contract fixed term contract there is nothing is simply over for the employee,Irrelevant
In case of dismissal Dismissal can be caused by many things usual causes ,Irrelevant
If the dis missal is sufficiently justified HR will take care of giving notice,Relevant
In the event of a decision to discontinue redirection to another hospital it is up to the employee to request advance notice,Relevant
HR will ensure that the notice period is acceptable,Relevant
This process especially concerns the Meuse Tube Clinic in Flmalle this clinic belongs to the CHBA group,Irrelevant
However the process cannot be the same as in Seraing,Irrelevant
When a patient wishes to make an appointment he can do so through three different channels this can be done by phone by mail or on the spot at the counter,Relevant
In all three cases the patient will come across the reception desk of the clinic,Relevant
However if it is done by e mail it may take longer to get an answer,Irrelevant
The receptionist will look at the places available and suggest an appointment date to the patient then an appointment will be scheduled,Relevant
The person at the reception desk will then check his or her contact details via his or her identity card and health insurance,Relevant
The patient has to pay directly on the spot he will eventually receive an invoice,Relevant
After waiting in the waiting room the doctor sees the patient,Relevant
He will check the patient s medical history in the CPR computerized patient record examine the patient and give recommendations for treatment,Relevant
Eventually the doctor may request additional tests if the situation requires it or even transfer the patient to the emergency room in case of an emergency,Relevant
He can also schedule a hospitalization if he wants to follow the patient in real time,Relevant
The invoicing service will take care of the invoice which will depend on the technical services performed during the consultation the status of the person and his or her health insurance company,Relevant
The maintenance and repair process uses one main software Carpark,Irrelevant
Indeed Carpark allows the management of all the vehicles from all the parks thanks to its database that includes all the information necessary about the vehicles from all the subsidiaries the number plate the intern references but also the location of the maintenance the maintenance plan that suits the vehicle the most according to the recommendation of the suppliers Moreover drivers also use Carpark in order to encode the kilometers travelled with the busses which allows the automated planning of the maintenance every 15 000 or 30 000 kilometers depending on the bus,Relevant
Those planned maintenances are sorted 1 500 kilometers in advance by the software in order for the technical and maintenance head to be able to plan their actual execution with the mechanics,Relevant
Of course more completion dates can be added manually in accordance with a specific date of a specific number of kilometers travelled,Relevant
Lastly Carpark keeps the history of all the maintenances and repairs that have been done on each vehicle,Relevant
The repair process starts with the transmission of a complaint through Carpark,Relevant
With this complaint a driver signals a damage a breakdown or an accident after having made a research with the number of the vehicle in order to verify that the damage has not already been signaled and avoid any duplication,Relevant
The content of the complaint is the following the problem the vehicle concerned its kilometers travelled and if the driver wants to his email address or his phone number in order to receive a message when the complaint is taken in charge,Irrelevant
The technical and maintenance head can consult the list of all the complaints in Carpark,Irrelevant
He then decides of the moment the complaint has to be treated depending on the urgency of the problem,Relevant
If the problem is considered as urgent the technical and maintenance head directly visits the garage where the repair is going to be done in order to find mechanics who are available to take the bus in charge,Relevant
Otherwise the repair is planned for a later day and will be taken in charge during the daily morning meeting between the technical and maintenance head and the mechanics where the work of the day is divided up,Relevant
The technical and maintenance head creates the workshop sheet related to each repair,Relevant
This sheet includes a description of the problem as well as the work that has to be done by the mechanics and is identified by a specific codebare,Irrelevant
If the driver who transmitted the complaint gave a phone number or an email address a message is automatically sent to him when the workshop sheet is created in order to let him know that the complaint is taken into account and that the bus is sent to the garage for repairs,Relevant
Following the daily planning of the mechanics the technical and maintenance head sends the workshop sheets to the ones concerned by the repair,Relevant
With the use of a clocking software each mechanic scans the barcode of the workshop sheet to indicate when he takes it in charge and then when he is done with the execution of its content,Relevant
That enables the technical and maintenance head to know which repairs are ongoing and which ones are finished but also to know the workforce that has been required for each of them,Irrelevant
Moreover the mechanic indicates in the workshop sheet every piece that he used for the repair by scanning the barcode of them which also allows an easy following of the evolution of the stock ,Relevant
Once the mechanic has finished the repairs the completed workshop sheet is sent back to the technical and maintenance head who closes it,Relevant
That finally permits the creation of the invoice as well as the suppression of the complaint in the list in Carpark,Relevant
Of course in order to make repairs on busses it is essential to have efficient stock maintenance of the pieces required for those repairs,Irrelevant
It is the role of the technical and maintenance head to create the purchase orders communicate them to the suppliers take the delivery control and approve the invoices,Relevant
Once a new piece arrives either it is immediately used because it has been ordered for a specific repair that is ongoing or urgent or the piece enters the stock,Relevant
Each piece of the stock is identified by a particular barcode which is also useful to keep track of the pieces used during each repair as mentioned previously and has a particular place in the warehouse determined by a departement a shelf and a level,Relevant
Keolis Belgium and its subsidiaries owns many gas stations with their fuel pumps but they also manage the tankage of other stations in areas where they don t own any cistern,Irrelevant
This mix of their own tanks and the external tanks is centralized in one software Telenaro where the internal tanks are continuously updated and the data from their external clients are imported two times a month,Relevant
Telenaro gathers all the societies vehicles of the group internal and external drivers and data related type of vehicle maximum level of the fuel tank baseline consumption current consumption and all the other details linked with the tankage,Relevant
That permits automated statistics about the consumption of fuel as a way of efficient control despite the size of the entire group and the number of stations vehicles and cisterns,Relevant
Moreover the forecasting of the resupply of each cistern is based on an estimated range computed from the average daily consumption registered,Relevant
Lastly Telenaro keeps the history of all the deliveries of fuel the deltas given by the probes see further the alerts from problems during a delivery etc,Relevant
Any anomaly in Telenaro can be corrected manually by an operator,Relevant
A new system of probes installed in some of the cisterns of the company gives an on live view of the fuel level,Relevant
In parallel to the probes the level is also computed from the documented tanks and resupplies in Telenaro,Relevant
The delta between the probed level and the computed one allows the operators to identify any problems in the supply of fuel or in the tankage of some vehicles i e the amount of fuel delivered do not correspond to the one indicated on the invoice of the supplier a driver tries to defraud by taking some fuel for its 7 own personal consumption in winter a quite big difference can come from the high consumption of the heaters for the scholar cars ,Irrelevant
The probe of a cistern also detects if the amount of fuel varies whereas no delivery is ongoing because of a leak of fuel or a theft which triggers an alarm,Relevant
It even gives the level of water in the cistern due to the condensation in the cisterns so that the operators know when they need to evacuate some of that water,Relevant
Most importantly the probes replace the previously needed and costly physical presence of an operator in order to verify and control the proper conduct of each resupply,Relevant
The starting point of the resupply of a cistern is its low level of fuel,Irrelevant
To know if any tankage is required the manager of a society can easily visualize the level of each cistern of its society thanks to Telenaro and its icons and colored level bars see the adjacent illustration ,Irrelevant
In addition the system automatically sends an alert to the manager when a particular level of fuel is reached whereas no tankage is planned yet,Relevant
When the operator decides that an order is needed he calls for tenders and the best price gets the order,Relevant
Then the manager makes the order to the supplier and sends an email to the subsidiaries in order to inform the local managers of the upcoming resupply,Relevant
All the ongoing orders are also registered in Telenaro,Relevant
When the delivery man arrives at the location of the delivery the operator in charge at the station gives him the delivery probe that has to be scanned at the pump to allow the tankage as well as to confirm to Telenaro that the delivery is made,Relevant
After the tankage the delivery man encodes the amount of fuel he just delivered and the system will compare that amount to the one measured by the probe,Relevant
If they do not correspond the system asks the delivery man to re encode the amount and makes the verification again,Relevant
After three times asking for re encodage if the encoded amount and the probed amount still do not correspond the system sends a message to the firm in order to signal it,Relevant
Then the delivery is confirmed by the system to the operator in charge as well as to Telenaro,Relevant
The system automatically creates and sends the invoice to the society that benefited from the delivery and a copy to the manager in charge so that he is able to control if the delivery corresponds to the negotiations made at the moment of the ordering,Relevant
It also generates the excise documents for the recovering as well as the official declaration for the Ministry,Relevant
When an operator from any department wants to make a purchase he has to fill in an investment request,Relevant
Four different investment requests are used in Keolis Belgium for ,Relevant
? Rolling stock buses for regular lines scholar lines tourisms but also trailers for the luggages ,Relevant
? No rolling stock supplies for the garages tools compressors ,Relevant
? Properties buildings but also air conditioning garage doors led lights bus wash ,Relevant
? IT infrastructures cabling laptops desktops servers magnetic access cards surveillance cameras ,Relevant
See the annexes for samples of the four investment requests,Irrelevant
Once the investment request is completed the amount of the expense is controlled by the purchase department regarding the budgetization of the year,Relevant
If the management validates the purchase the investment request has now to be signed by the supervisor of the departments concerned by the purchase as well as a head of the purchase department in order to acknowledge the validation of the purely budgetary aspect,Relevant
Once the investment request has been signed it is sent via email to the supplier that launches the delivery,Relevant
In order to close the process the invoice still has to be validated by the purchase department that confirms the purchase,Relevant
The firm has a few master contracts with some suppliers and all the subsidiaries are strongly encouraged to make their purchases through those master contracts as a priority,Irrelevant
Of course case by case exceptions are possible but this tolerance toward the appeal to other suppliers is supervised if a department constantly makes purchases with other suppliers that the ones concerned by the master contracts negotiated by the organisation an operational manager or an head of the subsidiary will make sure it stops,Relevant
In fact 76 of the purchases of the organisation are made within master contracts,Irrelevant
For example all the OPEX Operational Expenditures that concern office supplies are subject to master contracts,Irrelevant
If no master contract concerns the purpose of the purchase and if the amount if that purchase exceeds 5 000 euros three offers generally have to be collected before making a choice of a supplier in order to compare the price quality ratios the delivery time the quality of the after sales service etc,Relevant
here again exceptions are of course possible ,Irrelevant
The final choice of a supplier is made by the purchase department in tandem with the ones who will benefit from the purchase,Relevant
Besides those master contracts the company also has some price conventions and other pre negotiated purchase terms with some other suppliers,Irrelevant
Whenever the company wants to broaden the number of clients it reaches the very first step concerns the work of the marketing team,Relevant
The aim is to get information about potential clients in order to determine if the company can propose valuable services to them and conclude an order,Irrelevant
This preparation is essential because it is the foundation of the sale process the sales representatives from the commercial team have to be well prepared for the coming negotiation,Irrelevant
Once the information has been collected through market analysis the commercial team contacts the potential client and a first negotiation takes place,Relevant
The aim is to determine whether the client is interested by the potential offer and the sales representative bases its argumentation on the client analysis previously communicated by the marketing department,Relevant
After the negotiation and if the client is indeed interested a first offer is created,Relevant
This offer needs to be signed by several managers if the offer is not appropriated it might compromise the sale,Relevant
After having been signed the offer is sent to the client by email,Relevant
If the client directly accepts the offer the sale is validated and the processes of invoicing and delivering can start,Relevant
But if the client is not entirely satisfied with the proposition more negotiations can take place in order to have the approval of the client while still respecting the frames and goals from the management,Relevant
Repeating the last circle several times would be very heavy due to the long approbation chain but that almost never occurs generally if the second offer is still not validated by the client the sale is cancelled,Relevant
At the beginning of each month the account of more than 40 small societies that all kept their legal entity need to be closed in 4 working days,Relevant
To do so a lot of accountants work in the subsidiaries and each of them close two or three files within 4 days,Relevant
Their work mainly consists in verifying and gathering the invoices as well as the charges,Irrelevant
For the invoices the ones that concern the regular services and the scholar services come directly from the manager at the moment of the service provision and immediately verified by the accountant,Relevant
On the other side for the taxis the tourism sector invoices to be drawn up are used because the very end of the service needs to be reached in order to know the total costs engaged,Relevant
For the charges the accountants have to look into the salaries and wages,Relevant
In the organisation those are based on the real pay on what has actually been paid with almost no accounting provisions,Irrelevant
All the other types of charges are also taken into account rent provisions fuel costs charges from invoices that still need to be drawn up properties maintenance As mentioned right above within 4 working days starting at the 1st of the month the accountants have to close their files and send them to the management accountants for verification and for a fist analysis,Irrelevant
Keolis Belgium comprises 3 management accountants one for Wallonia one for Flanders and one for Brussel,Irrelevant
Thus on the 4th of the month they verify the work of the accountants according to the budgetization of the month and the year the fluctuations from month to month etc,Relevant
They have a more global vision that is both operational and budgetary,Irrelevant
After receiving the approval from the management accountants the accountants inject the files in BOFINANCE the reporting tool used by Keolis SA that has its headquarters in France,Relevant
The headquarter then consolidates the accounts and adds on top operations such as adjusted depreciation expenses to make those accounts correspond to the International Financial Reporting Standards,Relevant
The 3 management accountants then receive the consolidated accounts consolidate them again into 3 reports one for each region and a second analysis takes place estimation of the gaps between the non consolidated and the consolidated accounts identification of the impact of the events of the month i e the price variation of the fuel on the turnover as well as on each part of the business of the organisation scolar part tourism part regular services part etc,Relevant
This analysis is a from the real to the budget analysis a waterfall of all the impacts is made in order to obtain the budget of the month,Relevant
Currently the impact of the covid crisis is at the center of those monthly analyses,Irrelevant
If the impact on scholar transportation is relatively small the one on the tourism sector is huge since all the activities are stationary,Irrelevant
Moreover the reinforcements asked by La TEC that needed more vehicles also have had consequences,Irrelevant
On the 5th day of the month the management accountants send the 3 reports to the directors of each region,Relevant
It is indeed important that the results of their analysis are communicated with the operational managers,Irrelevant
Finally on the 6th day of the month the management accountant of Wallonia consolidates the 3 reports in order to obtain one consolidated report for Belgium which is required by the headquarter in France,Relevant
Empty bottles are returned by the customers once the bottles are received we sort the types of bottles before washing them afterwards we control the cleanliness of the bottles and the quality of the bottles with a laser to detect the slightest defect,Relevant
If the bottles have defects they are rejected and if not they are kept,Relevant
Then the bottles are filled captured labelled and marked with the expiry date,Relevant
Then the bottles go to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
AB Inbev needs bottles so they will order the bottles from their suppliers,Relevant
The suppliers check the order if it is accepted a confirmation is sent to AB Inbev then the suppliers plan the transportation then they send the invoice and at the same time the bottles are delivered by truck to AB Inbev,Relevant
Once the trucks are received AB Inbev unload the trucks and then they check the goods if everything is good the bottles are stored if not AB Inbev sends the bad products back to the suppliers and the suppliers will send a new invoice and the good products or missing products to AB Inbev who will unload the trucks check the goods before storing them,Relevant
purchase order is received at the logistics department if it is a new customer it has to be entered into the VPO System which is used by all AB Inbev breweries,Relevant
The VPO manager will then send the order information to the warehouse which will then check the availability of the beer for the order,Relevant
If everything is available the order is prepared otherwise a request is sent to the packaging department to produce the missing beer,Relevant
Once the beer is ready it is delivered and the invoice is sent to the customer,Relevant
AB InBev receives unsolicited applications but also via other channels Indeed and Forem the People department receives applications,Relevant
1 CV screening consists of the elimination of CVs that do not meet the criteria requested by the company and when information is missing we send an e mail to warn the candidate,Relevant
If they do not meet the criteria their application will not have been selected,Relevant
2 The telephone interview the recruiter will contact the selected candidates by telephone 5 10 minutes ,Relevant
If he is convinced he will invite the candidate to the recruitment morning,Relevant
3 The recruitment morning is a collective interview there is a series of tests,Relevant
Successful candidates are contacted by telephone to invite them to the next interview with the N+1 or N+2,Relevant
4 Interview with the department manager The manager turns his interview more towards the personality of the candidate,Relevant
If the candidate is accepted he or she is invited to a training course,Relevant
5 Form Alim training Form Alim is a training course specially created for production operators in the food industry,Irrelevant
6 The first seasonal contract and coaching When signing the contract the candidate is invited to the People Department to complete documents,Relevant
7 The permanent contract If the employee receives a sufficient number of positive feedbacks his manager is satisfied with his work and ABI has the opportunity to do so he will be offered a permanent contract,Relevant
Different types of malts are put together in the tank,Relevant
They are crushed in order to extract the fermentable sugar,Relevant
The resulting product is then mixed with heated water in a vat,Relevant
Then the liquid is pumped into another tank in which the husks of the grains are separated from the suicidal liquid,Relevant
The liquid obtained is then subjected to strong heat in a kettle,Relevant
After this step we will be able to proceed to the fermentation process we will add hops and yeast which will convert the sugar into beer then we will cool the beer filter it and add CO2 to make the beer sparkling,Relevant
So all that remains is to wait until the beer is mature 3 weeks before it can be sold and consumed,Relevant
The aim of this process is to answer positively or not to an employee s holiday request,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee makes a request which is received by a human resource analyst,Relevant
The analyst takes charge of the request by changing its state to  pending  which means that the demand is neither approved nor rejected,Relevant
Then the request is sent to the manager of the requester s department,Relevant
This is the first step that the request has to go through,Irrelevant
If the manager rejects the request the analyst changes its state to  rejected  and the process ends with a notification sent to the employee,Relevant
Otherwise if the manager accepts the request the analyst changes the state of the request to  approved  and the first step is done,Relevant
After that the request also has to be granted by the human resource manager,Relevant
The aim of this process is to allocate human resources to a specific task,Irrelevant
To understand it properly it is common sense yet important to note a human resource cannot be assigned to a project if this one doesn t already exist,Irrelevant
In the same way we cannot create a project before having a customer to which it relates,Irrelevant
So in the most common cases the manager will want to allocate a human resource to a specific project so he is going to trigger the process by its higher start event,Relevant
Then he is going to create and fulfill the new resource page and add it on the project,Relevant
That leads straightly to the higher end event and this is the shortest way to go through the process,Relevant
Otherwise if after trying to create this page the software realizes that this new resource doesn t refer to an existing project the process leads the analyst to the creation of this one,Relevant
This is the role of the first gateway,Irrelevant
After successfully filling each step the process brings back the analyst on the first line and to the first end event,Relevant
In the same way if during the creation of a new project the software realizes that this project doesn t relate to a registered customer then the process leads the analyst in the encoding of this new customer,Relevant
This is the role of the purple gateway,Irrelevant
After having registered this new customer the process brings the employee back to the second and then to the first line that leads again to the first end event,Relevant
Of course we could imagine the case where the analyst would only want to create a new project or to register a new customer without immediately allocating a resource to it,Irrelevant
This is the role of the second and the third start events which respectively leads to the second and third end events,Irrelevant
This business process is triggered when the training manager wants to create a training,Relevant
If the training has not already been taught in the past then the manager has to create a whole new training,Relevant
cfr linked subprocess ,Irrelevant
Otherwise the manager only has to schedule the session of related training called then a session and contact the external trainer of his choice specialized in this field,Relevant
As the attendance needs to be recorded for obvious financial and organizational reasons the manager establishes a list of attendees thanks to the form sent earlier on and the IT training system,Relevant
1 week before the training s day a reminder is sent by email to the attendees,Relevant
After the session the manager has to perform 3 tasks simultaneously ask for a debrief apply the post training process and update attendees skills in the database,Relevant
That being done the whole process finally ends,Relevant
Subprocess If a training has not been given yet on a particular subject in the past the manager has to design the training and fill a form with the details of it,Relevant
If the HR director does not accept the training framework for various reasons the training being too expensive too time consuming for the human resources etc the manager has to re evaluate it and redesign the training,Relevant
Otherwise the manager can select the language the training will be given in French English or both ,Relevant
Finally he has to save the choices made before and this creates the training in their IT training system,Relevant
This BPMN is relative to the internal invoicing and the payment of an internal contract,Irrelevant
It happens when an entity of the group ARHS offers its services to another entity,Relevant
The accounting officer of the entity providing its services receives the framework which is the name given to an internal contract from the indebted entity s accounting department,Relevant
The latter selects lines corresponding to the framework and records it in Interco which is the software used for internal contracts,Relevant
After that the accounting officer clicks on the button send to invoice and the invoice is registered as to be received in FICO which is the general accountancy software,Relevant
Finally the accounting officer waits for the payment and sends a reminder after 30 days of waiting to the indebted entity,Relevant
They do not charge any kind of late fees to each other as they are all part of the same group,Irrelevant
Once it is received the invoice gets archived,Relevant
If the company finds an interesting profile the HR employee searches for information about them creates a proposal and sends them an email,Relevant
If the person rejects the proposal or does not respond to it within three weeks the process ends,Relevant
However if they accept the proposal the human resources employee calls them to set up a meeting a week later,Relevant
Once the interview has been made the HR employee arranges a visit to the company for a moment later,Relevant
Once the visit and the interview have been carried out a skills test for the potential future employee has to be taken,Relevant
Depending on their result the company decides whether to hire them or not,Relevant
If the answer is yes the company considers a contract proposal and calls the candidate to discuss it,Relevant
The company is then awaiting for their response,Relevant
The latter can accept or refuse the contract,Irrelevant
If the answer is negative a new call is scheduled to renegotiate the employment clauses,Relevant
If accepted the employee is hired and their profile is registered in the company system,Relevant
Another way to get into the hiring process is to apply through an online form on the company website or to spontaneously apply to the company,Relevant
In the first case the documents of the applicants their CV and the online form will be analyzed by a human resources employee,Relevant
In the second case the employee will only analyze the documents and CVs of the applicants,Relevant
Based on these documents the employee decides whether or not to go on with the process by calling the candidate if selected,Relevant
The process starts when a message from the MRP system2 is received,Relevant
Indeed to manufacture a pump for a customer they need material resources and the MRP system knows it so it sends notifications to the central purchasing department that will then take care of this information,Relevant
Then three activities have to be done in parallel  Create an X Flow3  Request for quotation to the supplier  Do a framework agreement price matrix it is done to calculate costs of the pump ,Relevant
When these 3 tasks are completed the company places an order with its supplier who then takes care of the delivery,Relevant
Then the product is sent to the quality control to check the quality of the products received,Relevant
If the quality does not meet the expectations they are sent back to the supplier and the supplier delivers better products or does some repairs on them,Relevant
If the quality is good they are sent to the Central purchasing department with the invoice,Relevant
When the invoice is received they have to validate the invoice in order to confirm that everything is ok and matches the information in the X Flow which allows the accounting department to free up money and the process ends like this,Relevant
The process starts when the planning department receives a sales order from the customer,Relevant
They are then able to prepare a preliminary planning and to give feedback to the project manager for the kick off meeting KOM ,Relevant
Then the master planner attends the KOM and thanks to the minutes of meeting MOM that he receives by mail he can update the planning and save a deadlines baseline that contains all the project s milestones,Relevant
The planning department can then launch the production order by putting it into the SAP system,Relevant
Then meetings take place each week until the end of the production,Relevant
In case there are delays due to some modifications in the plan of the pump or delays due to late deliveries from the supplier the project manager is informed and he gives this information to the planning department,Relevant
The planning is then updated,Relevant
The whole company is supposed to follow this planning and to act according to it,Irrelevant
The process ends when the pump is done,Relevant
The process starts when an idea of conception comes to the mind of somebody in the business unit,Relevant
Then the business unit makes a project proposal and a detailed analysis is done,Relevant
Then the product development team does the technical specifications and after that the stakeholders make an analysis of the product and decide whether it is feasible or not,Relevant
If they say that it is infeasible the process ends,Relevant
But if it is feasible then the business unit the product development team and the operations and procurement team meet during a kick off meeting to talk about the project,Relevant
Then those three teams work together in order to make a deeper analysis and conceptual generic drawings,Relevant
Then they still work together to set up a detailed drawing with technical specifications this time,Relevant
When those tasks are done the product development team realises final manufacturing drawings with all the composing parts,Relevant
Then the three teams above mentioned have to gather all the data to put it in the manufacturing file,Relevant
After all these activities the pump is ready to be sold so the product development team puts it in the product catalogue and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the production order is received from the SAP system,Relevant
The workers can then take the raw parts needed for a specific pump in the warehouse,Relevant
When it is done they send a notification to inform the SAP system that this step of the production is done,Relevant
Then the system sends a work order to the workers in the machining service and two activities are done in parallel the transformation of raw parts that is done by the workers and the one that is done by the subcontractor,Relevant
When all the pieces are transformed by the subcontractor or by the workers they can store those finished materials in the warehouse and once again inform the SAP system,Relevant
Then they receive another work order from SAP to pre assemble the pump,Relevant
When it is done they store the subsets and inform SAP,Relevant
Once again they receive a work order and they have to do two activities in parallel do the piping and assemble the bareshaft pump4,Relevant
Then when those two activities are done they can assemble the final pump and check its performance thanks to an internal and an external quality controller,Relevant
If the performance is of good quality the pump is dispatched,Relevant
A notification is then sent to SAP and the process ends,Relevant
If the performance is poor they solve the problem and then they check again if it is ok,Relevant
The process starts when the customer notifies a problem to the after sales department,Relevant
They receive the defective material at the plant and they create a file,Relevant
Then they are able to estimate a quote,Relevant
The next step is assessing the problem,Relevant
If the problem comes from the customer the warranty will not be applied but if the company is responsible for it the customer will have to pay nothing for the repairs,Relevant
In the case where the customer is under warranty they apply it,Relevant
If he is not under warranty a final quote is set up and the customer has to accept or to reject it,Relevant
If he rejects the quote the file is closed and the material is sent back,Relevant
The company can still charge him for the time they spent on the pump so they can also create an invoice before sending back the material,Relevant
In the case where he accepts the quote or right after having applied the warranty they create a work order WO ,Relevant
Then they get the material they need to do the repairs thanks to the central purchasing,Relevant
Then they have to consider if those are small or big repairs,Relevant
If a big repair has to be done they go on site to do it because of practical reasons then they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
If it is only small repairs they do it at Sulzer s workshop and then they send back the material,Relevant
Once it is done they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
Before really getting into the recruitment process it is important to know that Resultance tries its best to approach young people,Irrelevant
To do this Resultance is present in schools and on various recruitment sites to promote the company and attract young people,Irrelevant
The recruitment process takes place in several stages,Irrelevant
Applications are received by the HR managers who then sort and select the best applications,Relevant
Once an application is selected an interview is set up between the candidate and the HR managers,Relevant
Then the candidates selected after the first interview are interviewed by a partner of the firm,Relevant
Once the candidate has been selected the integration phase begins the candidate will receive a salary package from the HR department and a mentor will be appointed to supervise the new candidate and help him or her integrate as well as possible,Relevant
A form is sent to all members of the firm to inform them of the arrival of a new employee,Relevant
The integration process On the first day the employee is welcomed by the HR department and the administrative assistant,Relevant
The employee is given his or her work tools mobile phone PC car and is explained the IT tools used at Resultance,Relevant
They are told what they need to know about the firm the company s values are explained to them and they receive their assignment,Relevant
He will be attached to a project and will know the manager who is going to supervise it,Relevant
The welcome continues with the godfather or godmother over a meal to immediately create a relationship and ensure that the new employee is well integrated,Relevant
The employee is then monitored and supervised by his or her manager and feedback is given to ensure that he or she develops well,Relevant
A diagnosis is launched at the customer s premises an employee will describe the company its level of performance in the different departments,Relevant
Risks at the level of processes and organisation will be assessed,Relevant
The intensity of the changes will also be highlighted by the employees responsible for the diagnosis,Relevant
To do this Resultance uses the SWOT tool and focuses on the opportunities,Irrelevant
Once the diagnosis has been established the employees will share the findings and recommendations resulting from the client s analysis,Relevant
From this moment on improvement paths will be described and will reveal the quantitative and qualitative gains that can be made,Relevant
Then a member of staff will draw up a detailed action plan in the form of a gantt chart for each area of improvement,Relevant
Once the diagnosis has been made the areas for improvement put forward it is up to the management team to decide whether or not to take action,Relevant
The diagnosis will make it possible to define the duration of the mission and the number of employees required for the project,Relevant
Based on this an estimate can be drawn up and presented to the client,Relevant
Based on the investigation and on a formal decision taken by the management team a project is launched,Relevant
Resultance pursues the analysis of the client s company in order to gain credibility and establishes the collaborative relationship,Irrelevant
The employees responsible for the project build new tools propose new working methods and processes,Relevant
Workshops are set up at the client s premises to directly involve stakeholders in the changes proposed by Resultance employees,Relevant
Each new proposal must be validated by the steering committee responsible for ensuring that a project runs smoothly within a company ,Relevant
The tools are then deployed in the field,Relevant
In order to ensure that the methodologies are properly transformed into results Resultance employees working at the client s site set up and lead the teams to ensure that the new tools are actually implemented,Relevant
The teams are monitored until they reach the objectives set by Resultance,Relevant
This ensures a real collaborative relationship between Resultance and the client,Irrelevant
To ensure that the project runs smoothly a meeting is held once a week with the Resultance project manager and the client s internal project manager,Relevant
This makes it possible for example to resolve any problems immediately if there are any,Irrelevant
In addition to this every 4 to 6 weeks a steering committee with the management committee of the client company is set up to take stock of the actions carried out in the project to take stock of progress and any problems encountered,Relevant
This monitoring makes it possible to give new directions to the project or change priorities,Irrelevant
And finally Resultance ensures the proper transfer of knowledge and tools put in place to ensure sustainability,Relevant
The client is then autonomous and benefits from continuous improvement,Irrelevant
When a new employee joins the company his or her objectives and expectations are entered into the database of a tool called Workday ,Relevant
This tool centralizes and automates all the decisions related to human resources management such as managing holidays and leaves evaluations sending reminder for deadlines and registering automated approvals,Relevant
In addition this process requires little or no supervision,Irrelevant
This process of human resources management ends when the employee leaves GSK,Relevant
Once a customer has placed an order the documents related to the purchase are received at the factory while the documents related to transport and the products badge with date of production and expiry date are handled manually,Relevant
The warehouse verifies on paper that the data on the pallets is consistent with the order,Relevant
Then the papers are scanned and sent to the quality team,Relevant
The quality team makes verifications before signing and archiving the file,Relevant
After that the products related to the order can be released,Relevant
This process starts when a client requests a pricing offer to the local Belgian GSK team,Relevant
An employee receives the request and prepares a pricing offer,Relevant
Then according to the 4 eyes principle another employee from the Belgian team checks the offer,Relevant
If there is a discrepancy the offer is corrected,Relevant
When the offer is finally approved it is sent to the central team in India to copy it in SAP,Relevant
The central team signals that the offer is confirmed to the local Belgian team by email,Relevant
When this email is received in Belgium the offer is confirmed to the client,Relevant
There are 3 possibilities for GSK to receive an order for their products from a customer ,Relevant
The customer can place his order through a sales representative of GSK during a physical visit,Relevant
This case applies mainly to the pharmacies,Irrelevant
The representative encodes the order on a tablet connected to the GSK ordering system,Relevant
The customer can also place orders by e mailing the company,Relevant
When the e mail is received the customer service checks the availability of the products ordered,Relevant
The order is checked and sent to the warehouse if the items are in stock,Relevant
In case of shortage the customer is of course notified,Relevant
The third possibility consists in the customer using GSK s platform thanks to a personal identifier interfaced with EDI Electronic Data Interchange ,Relevant
Once the order is confirmed it is sent to the warehouse,Relevant
After receiving the order the warehouse verifies that the information is correct,Relevant
Then a staff member in the warehouse picks up the different articles with a cart,Relevant
Once the products are picked up they are boxed and packed,Relevant
Then the order is placed on pallets to be delivered to the customer,Relevant
The tracking of the order and the expected delivery time can be consulted at any time by the customer thanks to the label on the order,Irrelevant
When the products are received by the customer the invoice is sent,Relevant
This process starts when a customer has a complaint about the price or the quantity of one order,Relevant
He or she has to contact the customer service,Relevant
Even if the contact is made by phone an e mail has to be sent to have a written proof of the complaint,Relevant
Then the customer service has to ask the sales manager if the correct price was applied the right quantity was sent,Relevant
If it is the process ends with sending an email of rejection of complaint to the costumer,Relevant
If the price quantity is not correct the customer service generates a credit note and send it to the sales manager who has to print sign scan before sending it back to the customer service,Relevant
Then the customer service also has to print sign scan send it and reimburse the customer,Relevant
The law obliges GSK to keep proof of the complaint for 7 years,Irrelevant
This storage is currently done through paper format documents,Irrelevant
There are two ways to find out something is missing,Irrelevant
Due to the digital transformation most of the inventory is automatically done at the end of the day,Irrelevant
So every morning the supply manager when he sees the ERP alert purchases the products missing or practically missing ,Relevant
The manager is constantly prospecting but if something is missing he does not have the time to ask every supplier to make a quote that is a support activity,Relevant
The other way to find out something is missing is by a warehouse worker,Relevant
Thanks to ERP it is hardly happening,Irrelevant
But if while he is picking products something is missing or the quality is not good enough he will directly alert the supply manager so he will purchase new ones,Relevant
Suppliers are listed in the supplier database where the manager can retrieve which product is from which supplier,Irrelevant
The invoice is finally sent to the financial department where it will be paid,Relevant
Most of the leads are firstly received by a telemarketer by mail or by a phone call,Relevant
They will take the information about the client and insert them into the Customer database ,Relevant
We will assume that every lead is about B2B,Irrelevant
If the client does not need delivery or a quote he should go to the cash and carry shop in Droixhe,Relevant
The telemarketer will then send the address of the delivery to receive a day of delivery for the client,Relevant
If for some reason the day proposed by the transporter does not suit the client the financial department will analyze if it could economically be possible to charter a truck just for him,Relevant
If not the lead will be aborted,Relevant
If the client agrees and does not need a physical appointment the telemarketer will make a quote,Relevant
Otherwise he will attribute the client to a salesman available who will set an appointment and make the quote,Relevant
When the first quote is made by the salesman or the telemarketer the client might refuse it or accept it,Relevant
If the client accepts it the contract will be signed and the order made,Relevant
If not he might not be interested anymore and the case would be closed or he might want a better quote,Relevant
The salesman telemarketer will need approval from the financial department to lower prices or make a promotion,Relevant
If it is not possible to do a better quote the case will be closed,Relevant
If it is the salesman telemarketer will make the new quote which might once again be approved or refused by the client,Relevant
And so on until the client declined the offer or consented to it,Relevant
When the order arrived at the warehouse if there are some products that need to be pre commanded the manager will do so and the order will be handled as soon as delivered,Relevant
Otherwise he will assign the order to an available worker,Relevant
He will receive the order on his scanner,Relevant
It indicates the emplacement of products and their quantity,Irrelevant
If the product needed is not there the work must advise the manager so he can report the error corrects the database and purchases the product needed,Relevant
Every time the picker picks something he must check the quality and the expiration date in order to avoid any return,Relevant
When all the products of the order are picked the worker needs to check that the weight and the volume correspond to what is expected by the ERP,Relevant
Then if everything is right the worker will confirm the order and emit the shipment order,Relevant
If the order is canceled the financial department will determine the cancelation penalty and charge it to the customer and if the product was not shipped yet the manager will handle the product return,Relevant
When the order is delivered the transporter sends a delivery note to the financial department,Relevant
Then every Monday they emit the invoice for every customer delivered,Relevant
If after 14 days they still do not have the payment they will send a reminder,Relevant
If after another 14 days the order is still unpaid the debt recovery will start and the client will be stuck,Relevant
